pure NAT Router. Port Triggering is used for some of these applications that can work with an 
NAT Router.  
 
Figure 4-42  Port Triggering  
Once the router is configured, the operation is as follows:  
1. A local host makes an outgoing connection using a destination port number defined in the 
Trigger Port field.  
2. The router records this connection, opens the incoming port or ports associated with this 
entry in the Por t Triggering table, and associates them with the local host.  
3. When necessary the external host will be able to connect to the local host using one of the 
ports defined in the Incoming Ports field.  
 Trigger Port - The port for outgoing traffic. An outgoing c onnection using this port will 
"Trigger" this rule.  
 Trigger Protocol - The protocol used for Trigger Ports, either TCP, UDP , or All (all 
protocols supported by the router) . 
 Incoming Port  - The port or port range used by the remote system when it responds t o the 
outgoing request. A response using one of these ports will be forwarded to the PC that 
triggered this rule. You can input at most 5 groups of ports (or port section). Every group of 
ports must be set apart with ",". For example, 2000 -2038, 2050 -2051,  2085, 3010 -3030.

 802.11n - 802.11n builds upon previous 802.11 standards by adding MI MO (multiple -input 
multiple -output). MIMO uses multiple transmitter and receiver antennas to allow for increased 
data throughput via spatial multiplexing and increased range by exploiting the spatial 
diversity, perhaps through coding schemes like Alamouti coding. The Enhanced Wireless 
Consortium (EWC) [3] was formed to help accelerate the IEEE 802.11n development 
process and promote a technology specification for interoperability of next -generation 
wireless local area networking (WLAN) products.  
 802.11b  - The 802.11b standard specifies a wireless networking at 11 Mbps using 
direct -sequence spread -spectrum (DSSS) technology and operating in the unlicensed radio 
spectrum at 2.4GHz, and WEP encryption for security. 802.11b networks are also referred to 
as Wi -Fi networks.  
 802.11g  - specification for wireless networking at 54 Mbps using direct -sequence 
spread -spectrum (DSSS) technology, using OFDM modulation and operating in the 
unlicensed radio spectrum at 2.4GHz, and backward compatibility with IEEE 802.11b devi ces, 
and WEP encryption for security.  
 DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name System)  - The capability of assigning a fixed host and 
domain name to a dynamic Internet IP Address.  
 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - A protocol that automatically configure the 
TCP/IP parameters for the all the PC(s) that are connected to a DHCP server.  
 DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) - A Demilitarized Zone  allows one local host to be exposed to the 
Internet for a special -purpose service such as Internet gaming or videoconferencing . 
 DNS (Domain Name System)  - An Internet Service that translates the names of websites into 
IP addresses.  
 Domain Name - A descriptive name for an address or group of addresses on the Internet.  
 DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) - A technology that allows data to be sent or received over 
existing traditional phone lines . 
 ISP (Internet Service Provider) - A company that provides access to the Internet.  
 MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit ) - The size in bytes of the largest packet that can be 
transmitted.  
 NAT (Network Addres s Translation) - NAT technology translates IP addresses of a local area 
network to a different IP address for the Internet.  
 PPPoE (Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet) - PPPoE is a protocol for connecting remote 
hosts to the Internet over an always -on co nnection by simulating a dial -up connection.  
 SSID - A Service Set Identification is a thirty -two character (maximum) alphanumeric key TL-MR3040  Portable Battery Powered 3G/ 4G Wireless N Router  
 
-226- identifying a wireless local area network. For the wireless devices in a network to 
communicate with each other, all devic es must be configured with the same SSID. This is 
typically the configuration parameter for a wireless PC card. It corresponds to the ESSID in 
the wireless Access Point and to the wireless network name.  
 WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) - A data privacy mech anism based on a 64 -bit or 128 -bit or 
152-bit shared key algorithm, as described in the IEEE 802.11 standard.  
 Wi-Fi - A trade name for the 802.11b wireless networking standard, given by the Wireless 
Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA, see http://www.wi -fi.net), an industry standards 
group promoting interoperability among 802.11b devices.

-1- Chapter 1.  Introduction  
1.1 Overview of the Router  
TP-LINK understands the need for sharing the 3G/ 4G connection locally that benefits our end 
users. We realize the convenience with our latest wireless N 3G /4G Router s ----- they give you 
the freedom to quickly set up a stable and hi gh speed wireless network, up to 150 Mbps, 
on-the-go and share a 3G/ 4G connection. By connecting a LTE/HSPA/UMTS/EVDO  USB Card 
to the Router , a Wi -Fi hotspot is instantly established allowing users to share a Internet 
connection anywhere 3G/ 4G coverage is available. So whether you’re on the train, camping, or 
at a construction site, you’ll have a reliable wireless connection to accommodate your 
networking needs.  
 
The router provides 3G /4G and WAN (xDSL, static IP, or dynamic IP) two kinds of broadband 
connections to get on the Internet, you can via the I nternet no matter at  home or outside on 
business. Automatic 3G/ 4G and WAN failover feature just provide nonstop internet connection.

connection for solid security in under a minute.   
 QoS acts as a “bandwidth manager” to ensure that those programs that are sensitive to lag are 
given as much bandwidth as possible to avoid lag. This feature makes an impression 
immensely when users are streaming video or music and especially when playing online games 
where lag often means “Game Over” .

 802.11n - 802.11n builds upon previous 802.11 standards by adding MIMO (multiple- input 
multiple -output). MIMO uses multiple transmitter and receiver antennas to allow for increased 
data throughput via spatial multiplexing and increased range by exploiting the spatial diversity, 
perhaps through coding schemes like Alamouti coding. The Enhanced Wireless  Consortium 
(EWC) [3] was formed to help accelerate the IEEE 802.11n development process and promote a technology specification for interoperability of next -generation wireless local area

 Chapter 1  Introduction 
Auranet  series products provide wireless coverage solutions for small -medium business . They 
can either work independently as standalone APs or b e centrally managed by the EAP 
Controller software , providing a flexible, richly -functi onal but easily -configured enterprise -
grade wireless network for small and medium business . 
“Celling lamp” appearance and easily mounting design with chassis make EAP easy to be 
installed on a wall or ceiling and blend in with most interior decorations .

 Chapter 2  Network  Topology  
A typical network  topology for the EAP is shown  below.  
            
Figure 2-1 Typical Topology  
To deploy an EAP in your local network, a DHCP server is required to assign IP addresses to the 
EAP and clients. Typically, a router acts as the DHCP server.  A computer running the EAP 
Controller softwa re can locate in the same or different subnet with the EAPs.  
The EAP can be managed by the EAP Controller software, which is a management software 
specially designed for the TP -LINK EAP devices on a local wireless network, allowing you to 
centrally configu re and monitor mass EAP devices using a web browser on your PC. For more 
information about the EAP Controller, please find the EAP Controller User Guide from  our 
official website:

 Chapter 3  Management M ode  
Auranet series products  can either work under the control of the EAP Controller software or 
work independently as a standalone access point.  
When user establishes a large -scale wireless network, the management of every single AP in 
the network is complex and complicated. With the EAP Controller software, you can centrally 
manage the mass APs simply in a web browser.  
The Standalone mode applies to a relatively small -sized wireless network. EAPs  in the Sta ndalone 
mode cannot be managed centrally by the EAP Controller software . 
3.1 Standalone Mode  
By default, the EAP works independently as a standalone access point. By entering the IP address 
of the st andalone EAP , you can log in to its web interface and perform configurations.  
The factory default IP address configuration of the EAP is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol). Before you access the web interface of the EAP , please make sure the DHCP s erver 
works properly. Typically, a router acts as the DHCP server.  
Follow the steps below to log in to the web interface of a standalone EAP .  
1. Connect your wireless devices to the EAP by using the default SSID printed on the label of 
the EAP device.  
2. Launch a web browser, enter http://tplinkeap.net in the address bar and press the Enter  key.  
3. Enter admin  (all lowercase) for both username and password to login.  
3.2 Managed Mode  
The EAP will become a managed AP once it is adopted via the EA P Controller s oftware. Users 
can manage the AP via a web browser. Refer to the EAP Controller User Guide from our 
website at  www.tp -link.com  to know more about EAP Controller software . 
3.3 Switch to Standalone Mode  
The web interface of a specific EAP is not available once this EAP is adopted by the EAP 
Controller. You can Forget  the EAP via the EAP Controller  to turn it back as a standalone AP . 
Refer to the EAP Controller User Guide from our website at www.tp -link.com  to learn more.  
TIPS : 
Proceed to the following chapters for information on using the EAP in standalone mode. EAP330 
is taken as the example.  
4 
 Chapter 4  Network  
On Network  page  you can  configure the IP address  of the standalone EAP .  
 
Figure 4-1 Network  Page  
Dynamic/Static:  By default, the EAP device  obtain s an IP address from a DHCP server (typically a 
router). Select Static to configure IP address manually.  
Fallback IP:  If the EAP fails to get a dynamic IP address from a DHCP server within ten 
seconds, the fallback IP will work  as the IP address of the device. After that, 
however, the device will keep  trying to  obtain an IP address from the DHCP 
server until it succeeds.  
DHCP Fallback 
IP/IP MASK:  Enter  the fallback IP/IP m ask. 
DHCP Fallback Gateway:  Enter the fallback gateway.

5.1.1  Wireless Basic Settings  
 
Figure 5-3 Wireless Basic Settings  
2.4GHz Wireless 
Radio:  Check the box to enable 2.4GHz Wireless Radio.  
Wireless Mode:  Select  the protocol standard for  the wireless network.  
For 2.4GHz network, we recommend that select 802.11b/g/n,  in which way 
clients supporting any one of these  mode s can access your wireless network.  
For 5GHz network, we recommend that select 802.11a/n or 802.11a/n/ac, in 
which way clients supporting any one of these  mode s can access your wireless 
network.  
Channel Width:  Select the channel width of this device.  
According to IEEE 802.11n standard, using a  higher  bandiwidth can increase 
wireless throughput. However, users may choose lower bandwidth due to the 
following  reasons:  
1. To increase the available number of channels within the limited total 
bandwidth.  
2. To avoid interference from overlapping channels occupied by other 
devices in the environment.  
3. Lower bandwidth can concentrate higher transmit power, increasing 
stability of wireless links over long distances.  
Channel : Select the channel used by this device to improve wireless performance. 
1/2412MHz means the  Channel is 1 and the frequency is 2412MHz.  By default, 
channel is automatically selected.  
TIPS : 
Proceed to the following chapter for information on configuring the wireless network of the EAP. 
The configur ing information of 2.4GHz is taken as the example.  
8 
 Tx power : Enter the transmit power value. By default, the value is 20.  
If the maximum transmit power is set to be larger than local regulation allows, 
the maximum Tx power regulated will be applied in actual situation.  
NOTE : In most cases, it is unnecessary to select m aximum transmit power . 
Selecting larger transmit power than needed may cause interference to 
neighborhood. Also it consumes more power and will reduce longevity of the 
device. Select a certain transmit power is enough to achieve the best 
performance.  
5.1.2  SSIDs  
SSIDs  can work together  with switches supporting 802.1 Q VLAN. Th e EAP  can build up to eight 
virtual wireless networks  per radio  for users to access. At the same time, it adds different VLAN 
tags to the clients which connect to the corresponding wirel ess network.  It supports maximum 
8 VLANs  per radio . The clients in different VLAN cannot directly communicate with each other.  
Clients connect ed to the device via cable do not  belong to any VLAN. Thus wired client can 
communicate with all the wireless clie nts despite the VLAN settings.  
Click  in the Modify column , the following content will be shown.  
 
Figure 5-4 SSIDs  
 Click to add up to 8 wireless networks  per radio .  
SSID  Name : Enter  up to 32 characters as the SSID name.  
Wireless VLAN 
ID: Set a VLAN ID  for the wireless network.  
Wireless  networks with the same VLAN ID  are grouped to a  VLAN.  
9 
 SSID 
Broadcast:  Enable this function , AP will broadcast its SSID  to hosts in the surrounding 
environment, as thus hosts can find the wireless network identified by this SSID. If 
SSID Broadcast is not enabled, hosts must enter the AP’s SSID manually to connect 
to this AP.  
Security Mode : Select the security mode of the wireless network. For the security  of wireless 
network, you are suggested to encrypt your wireless network. T his device 
provides three security modes: WPA -Enterprise , WPA -PSK  (WPA Pre -Shared Key) 
and  WEP  (Wired Equivalent Privacy). WPA -PSK is recommended. S ettings vary in 
different security modes as the details  are in the following  introduction . Select 
None  and the hosts can access the wireless network without password.  
Portal : Portal provides  authentication  service  for the clients who want to access the 
wireless local area network. For  more information, r efer to 5.2 Portal . After Portal 
is enabled, the configurations in 5.2 Portal  will be applied . 
SSID Isolation : After enabling SSID Isolation, the devices connected in the same SSID cannot 
communicate with each other.  
Modify : Click   to open the page to edit the parameters of SSID . 
Click  to delete the SSID . 
Following is the detailed introduction of security mode : WEP, WPA -Enterprise and WPA -PSK . 
 WEP  
WEP ( Wired Equivalent Privacy ), based on the IEEE 802.11 standard , is less safe than WPA-
Enterprise or WPA -PSK . 
NOTE:  
WEP  is not supported in  802.11n mode. If WEP is applied in 802.11n mode, the clients may not be 
able to access the wireless network. If WEP is applied in 11b/g/n mode (in the 2.4GHz frequency 
band) or 11a/n (in the 5GHz frequency band), the device may work at a low transmission rate.

Key Value:  Enter  the key  value.  
 WPA- Enterprise 
Based on RADIUS  server , WPA -Enterprise  can generate  different password s for different users and 
it is much safer than WPA -PSK. However, it costs much to maintain and is more suitable for 
enterprise users. At present, WPA -Enterprise has two versions: WPA-PSK  and WPA2 -PSK .

NOTE:  
Encryption type TKIP is not  supported in 802.11n mode. If TKIP is applied in 802.11n mode, the 
clients may not be able to access the wireless network of the EAP. If TKIP  is applied in 11b/g/n 
mode (in the 2.4GHz frequency band) or 11a/n (in the 5GHz frequency band), the device may work 
at a low transmission rate.  
 WPA- PSK  
Based on pre -shared  key, security mode  WPA -PSK  is characterized by high  security and simple 
configuration , which suits for common households and small business. WPA -PSK has two 
versions: WPA-PSK and WPA2 -PSK.  
 
Figure 5-7 Security Mode_WPA -PSK 
Version :  Auto : Select WPA  or WPA2 automatically based on the wireless station's 
capability and request.  
 WPA : Pre-shared key of WPA .

8640000 seconds . 
5.1.3  Wireless Advanced  Settings  
 
Figure 5-8 Wireless Advanced Settings  
Beacon Interval:  Beacons are transmitted periodically by the device to announce the presence of 
a wireless network for the clients. Beacon Interval value determines the time 
interval of the beacons sent by the device. You can speci fy a value from 40 to 
100. The default value is 100 milliseconds . 
DTIM Period : This value indicates the number of beacon intervals between successive 
Delivery Traffic Indication Messages (DTIM s) and t his number is included in each 
Beacon frame.  A DTIM is contained in Beacon frames to indicate whether the 
access point has buffered broadcast and/or multicast data for  the client devices . 
Following a Beacon frame containing a DTIM , the access point  will release the 
buffered broadcast and/or multicast data, if any exists.  You can specify the value 
between 1- 255 Beacon Intervals. The default value is 1, indicating the DTIM 
Period  is the same as Beacon Interval.  An excessive  DTIM  period  may reduce the 
performance of multicast applications . It is recommended to keep it by default.  
RTS Threshold : When the RTS  threshold  is activated, all the stations and APs follow the Request 
to Send  (RTS) protocol.  When the station is to send packets, it will send a RTS  to 
AP to inf orm the AP that it will send  data. After receiving the RTS, the AP notice s 
other  stations in the same wireless network to delay their transmitting of data. 
At the same time, the AP inform the requesting station to send data.  The value 
13 
 range  is from 1 to 2347 bytes. The default value is 2347 , which means that RTS is 
disabled.  
Fragmentation 
Threshold : Specify the fragmentation threshold for packets. If the size of the packet is larger 
than the fragmentation threshold, the packet will be fragmented into several 
packets. Too low fragmentation threshold may result in poor wireless 
performance caused by  the excessi ve packet s. The recommended  and default 
value is 2346 bytes.  
Airtime 
Fairness :(For 
EAP320/330/225 
only)  Airtime Fairness is a feature that boost the overall network performance by 
sacrifice a little bit of network time on your slowest devices. The relatively “slow” 
wifi speed devices can be slow from either long physical distance, weak signal 
strength, or si mply being a legacy device with older technology.  The setting 
takes away the monopoly in network time by the slower device (making the 
slower device even slower), dedicate and shift those processing time to the 
faster device to achieve better overall network performance.  
5.1.4  Load Balance  
By restricting the maximum number of clients  accessing  the EAPs , Load Balance h elps to  achieve 
rational use of network  resources.  
 
Figure 5-9 Load Balance  
Load Balance:  Disable by default.  Click ON to enable the function. After enabling  it, you 
can set a number for maximum associated clients  to control the wireless 
access.  
Maximum 
Associated Clients : Enter  the number of  clients to b e allowed for  connect ion to the EAP.  The 
number  ranges from 1 to 99.  
5.2 Portal  
Portal authentication enhances the network security by providing authentication service  to the 
clients that just need temporary access to the wireless network. Such clients have  to log into a 
web page to establish verification, after which they will access the network as  guests. What's 
more, you can customize the authentication login page and specify a URL  which the newly 
authenticated clients will be redirected to.  Please refer t o Portal Configuration  or Free 
Authentication Policy  according to your need.  
14 
 Following is the page of Portal . 
 
Figure 5-10 Portal Page  
NOTE:  
To apply  Portal in a wireless network, please go to Wireless →Wireless Settings →SSID s to enable 
Portal of a selected  SSID.  
5.2.1  Portal Configuration  
Three authentication types are available : No Authentication, Local Password and External 
RADIUS Server.

 No Authenticatio n：Users are required to finish only two steps: agree  with the user protocol and 
click the Login  button.  
Local Password ：Users are required to enter the preset password, which are saved in the EAP.  
External RADIUS Server ：U sers are required to enter the preset user name and password, which 
are saved in the database of the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server acts as the authentication 
serve r, which allows you to set different user name s and password s for different users.  
Refer to the following content to configure Portal based on actual network situations . 
 No Authentication  
 
Figure 5-11 Portal Configuration _No Authentication  
Authentication

Authentication Timeout : After successful  verification , an authentication session is established. 
Authentication Timeout decides the active time of the session. Within the 
active time, the device keeps the authentication session open with the 
associated client. To reopen the session, th e client needs to log in the web 
authentication page and enter the user name and password again once 
authentication timeout is reached.  
By default, authentication timeout is eight  hour s (For EAP110/120/220, the 
value is one hour). Select Custom from the dr op-down list to customize the 
parameter.

Queue : Queue displays the transmission queue. By default, the priority from high to 
low is Data 0, Data 1, Data 2, and Data 3. The priority may be changed if you 
reset the  EDCA parameters.  
Data 0 (Voice) —Highest priority queue, minimum delay. Time -sensitive 
data  such as VoIP and streaming media are automatically sent to this queue.  
Data 1 (Video) —High priority queue, minimum delay. Time -sensitive video 
data  is automatically sent to this queue.  
Data 2 (Best Effort) —Medium priority queue, medium throughput and 
delay.  Most traditional IP data is sent to  this queue.  
Data 3 (Background) —Lowest priority queue, high throughput. Bulk data 
that requires maximum throughput and is not time -sensitive is sent to this 
queue (FTP  data, for example).  
Arbitration Inter -
Frame Space:  A wait time for data frames. The wa it time is measured in slots. Valid values 
for Arbitration Inter -Frame Space are from 1 to  15.

Maximum 
Contention 
Window : The upper limit (in milliseconds) for the doubling of the random backoff 
value.  This doubling continues until either the data frame is sent or the 
Maximum  Contention Window size is reached.  
This value must be higher than the value for the Minimum Contention 
Window.  
Maximum Burst  The Maximum Burst  is a AP EDCA parameter that applies only to traffic 
flowing from the EAP devices  to the client station.  This value specifie s (in 
milliseconds) the maximum burst length allowed for  packet bursts on the 
wireless network. A packet burst is a collection of  multiple frames 
transmitted without header information. The decreased  overhead results in 
higher throughput and better performance.  
The valid values are multiples of 32 between 0 and 8192.

power off. All TP -LINK EAPs are equipped with Nvram. With this  option enabled, the Nvram 
feature can help reserve the system logs when an EAP device is power off.  
7.1.3  Backup Log   
TIPS : 
Only EAP320, EAP330 and EAP225 have this function.  
48 
 You can save the current system log to a file.  Following is the page of Backup Log . 
 
Figure 7-6 Backup Log  Page

Figure 7-9 Trunk Setting  
TIPS : 
Only EAP330 has this function.  
50 
 Enable:  Check the box  to enable Trunk .  
The Trunk function  can bundle  multiple Ethernet links into a logical link to 
increase bandwidth, improve reliabi lity and achieve load balanc ing.  
The EAP330 has two 1000Mbps Ethernet port s. If the Trunk function is 
enabled a nd the ports are in the speed of 1000Mbps Full Duplex, the whole 
bandwidth of the Trunk is up to 4 Gbps (2 000M bps * 2 ) because the 
bandwidth of each member port is 2000M bps. 
Mode : Select the applied mo de of Trunk  Arithmetic . The device will choose the port  
to transfer the packets based on the mode of Trunk Arithmetic . 
• SRC MAC + DST MAC: When this option is selected, the arithmetic will 
be based on the source and destination MAC addresses of the packets.  
• DST MAC: When this option is selected, the arithmetic will be based on 
the destination MAC addresses of the packets.  
• SRC  MAC: When this option is selected, the arithmetic will be based on 
the source MAC addresses of the packets.  
7.5 LED ON/ OFF

Figu re 7-10 LED ON/OFF  
7.6 SSH  
This device supports the SSH Server function that allows users to login and manage it through 
SSH connection on the SSH client software.  
SSH (Secure Shell) is a security protocol establ ished on application and transport layers. SSH -
encrypted -connection is similar to a telnet connection, but essentially the old telnet remote 
management method is not safe, because the password and data transmitted with plain -text 
can be easily intercepted.  SSH can provide information security and powerful authentication 
when you login this device remotely through an insecure network environment. It can encrypt 
all the transmission data and prevent the information in remote management from being leaked.  
51 
 Following is the page of  SSH . 
 
Figure 7-11 SSH Page  
Server Port:  Enter  the server port. By default, it  is port 22.  
SSH Login : Check the box  to enable SSH Server . By default, it is disabled.  
7.7 Management  VLAN  
Management VLAN provides a safer way  for you  to manage the EAP .  With Management VLAN 
enabled, only the hosts in the management VLAN can manage the EAP . Since most hosts cannot 
process VLAN tag s, connect the management  host  to th e network  via a switch , and set up correct 
VLAN settings for the switches on the network to ensure the communication between the host 
and the EAP in the management VLAN.  
Following is the page of Management VLAN . 
 
Figure 7-12 Management VLAN Page  
Management 
VLAN:  Enable or disable the Management VLAN feature.  
TIPS : 
Only EAP225/EAP330 has this function.  
52 
 Management 
VLAN ID:  Specify the Management VLAN ID, ranging from 1 to 4094.   
7.8 SNMP  
The device can be configured as an SNMP  agent.  
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), the most widely applied network management 
protocol, provides a management framework to monitor and maintain Internet devices. Main 
functions of SNMP include monitoring network performance, detecting and analyzing  network 
error, configuring network devices, and so on.  When networks function properly, SNMP can 
perform the functions of statistics, configuration and testing.  When networks have troubles, 
SNMP can detect and restore these troubles.  
An SNMP consist s of three key components : manager , agent and MIB (Management Information 
Base). SNMP manager is a client program operating at workstation, assisting network 
administrators to accomplish most network device management tasks. An agent is a network -
management soft ware module that resides on a managed device and responsible for receiving 
and dealing with data sent by managing device.  Generally  the managed devices are network 
devices including hosts, bridges, switches and routers. MIB is the collection of managed dev ices. 
It defines a series of properties of the managed devices. Every SNMP agent has its own MIB.  
Once the device has become an SNMP agent, it is able to receive and process request messages from SNMP manager.  
Following is the page of SNMP . 
 
Figure 7-13 SNMP Page  
53 
 SNMP Agent:  Enable  SNMP Agent  and the SNMP Agent will collect  the information of this 
device and respond to informati on requests from one or more management 
systems.  
SysContact : Enter the textual identification of the contact person for this managed node.  
SysName : Enter a n administratively -assigned name for this managed node.  
SysLocation : Enter the physical location of this managed node.  
Get 
Community:  Community refers to a host group aiming at  network  management. Get 
Community only has the read -only right of  the device's SNMP information. 
The community name can be considered a group password. The default 
setting is public . 
Get Source : Defines the IP address (for example, 10.10.10.1) or subnet for management 
systems that can serve as Get  Community to read the SNMP information  of this 
device.  The format of subnet is “IP address/bit ” (such as 10.10.10.0/24). The 
default is 0.0.0.0, which means all hosts can read the SNMP information of this 
device . 
Set Community:  Set Community has the read and write right of the device's SNMP 
information.  Enter the community name that a llows read/write access to the 
device's SNMP information. The community name can be considered a group 
password. The default setti ng is private . 
Set Source : Defines the IP address (for example, 10.10.10.1) or subnet for management 
systems that can serve as Set Community to read  and write  the SNMP 
information  of this device.  The format of subnet is “ IP address/bit ” (such as 
10.10.10. 0/24). The default is 0.0.0.0, which means all hosts can read and write 
the SNMP information of this device.  
 
NOTE:  
Defining community can allow management systems in the same community to communicate 
with the SNMP Agent. T he community name can be seen as the shared password of the network 
hosts group. T hus, for the security , we suggest modifying the default community name before 
enabling the SNMP Agent service. I f the field of community is blank, the SNMP Agent will not 
respond to any community name.  
 
54 
 Chapter 8  System

 1  Quick Start
Pharos Control is the management software for TP-Link Pharos devices. With this software, you 
can centrally manage all Pharos devices using a web browser. Follow the steps below to complete the basic set up.
1.  Determine the Network Topology
2.  Install Pharos Control 
3.  Log in to Pharos Control
4.  Add the Devices to be Managed
5.  Monitor and Manage the Network 2
1.1 Determine the Network Topology
You can use Pharos Control to centrally manage the devices in the same or different network 
segment.
1.1.1  Manage Devices in the Same Network Segment
To manage devices in the same network segment, refer to the following topology.
In the LAN, one host must have Pharos Control installed, and this host is called the Control Host. 
Other hosts in the same subnet can access the Control Host via a web browser to manage the devices. In the following topology, you can visit Pharos Control interface from Client A by entering “http://192.168.1.2: 9321” in a web browser. 
iips
 •Ensure the network reachability between Client and Control Host.
 •It's recommended to assign the Control Host with a static IP address to allow more convenient login to 
Pharos Control interface. 
 •T o manage the Pharos devices remotely via Internet, you need to open the service port on the router. For example, here the service port number is 9321.

Ntts
Pharos Control server must be running at all the times while you manage the network.
1.1.2  Manage Devices in Different Network Segment
If the Control Host needs to manage devices in different network segments, refer to the following 
topology. 
The Control Host and the devices are connected to different network segments of the router. 
Ensure the Pharos devices are able to reach the Control Host, and the Control Host will be able to manage the devices centrally. Similarly, other hosts on the network can access the Control Host via a web browser to manage the devices. 3
Ntts
 •The router should work in non-NAT mode.
 •For all the Pharos devices, make sure that firewall doesn’t block port 20002 and port 22. Port 20002 is 
used for discovery and port 22 is used for management by Pharos Control server.

With Pharos Control you can centrally monitor and manage your Pharos devices. This chapter 
includes the following sections:
 ■Monitor and Manage the Devices
 ■Manage the Firmware Files
 ■Configure Scheduled Tasks
 ■Configure Trigger Rules 18
2.1 Monitor and Manage the Devices
This chapter introduces how to monitor and manage the devices. First, you need to add the devices 
to be managed in Pharos Control. For detailed instructions, refer to Add the Devices to be Managed  
in Chapter 1. You can also group these devices according to your need. And then you can monitor the devices, and centrally manage them, such as reboot, upgrade and ping the devices. In addition, Pharos Control provides the map feature. With this feature, you can visually manage the devices on the map. 
The following sections introduce how to group, monitor and manage the devices, and how to use 
the map feature to facilitate your management.
2.1.1  Group the Devices
When there are a number of devices in the network, it is recommended to group these devices for efficient management and fast search. Pharos Control provides two kinds of groups: Auto group and Manual group. And in Auto group, there are two default groups: Managed and Unmanaged. The managed devices are in the Managed group, and the unmanaged devices are in the Unmanaged group. You can manually create more groups as needed. There are two methods:
 ■Auto Grouping: You can set the rules to automatically group the devices. For example, you can create an Auto group and set a rule that all the devices with a same SSID will be added to this group automatically. 
 ■Manual Grouping: You need to manually add the devices to the corresponding group. 19
Auto Grouping
Follow the steps below to create a new group and set a rule to automatically add the devices to this 
group:
1. Go to the Device page. Click Auto Grouping and click 
  .
2. In the pop-up window, specify a name for the new group and set one or more rules for this group. 
Click OK, and the devices matching the rules above will be added to the group automatically. 
For example, here we add two rules: “the client number is larger than 15” and the “CPU load is 
larger than 70%”. Then we choose “OR“ as the logical relation between the two rules, which means that a device will be automatically added to this group when meeting either one of the rules. Also you can select  “AND“  which means that a device will be automatically added to this 
group when it meets both the rules. You can click 
to add more rules and click 
  to delete the 
rule.  20
There are six types of matching rules:
contains It is used to compare the strings, such as device name, product, IP address 
and version. When the real string contains the specified consecutive string, 
the match of this rule is successful.
startswith It is used to compare the strings, such as device name, product, IP address 
and version. When the real string starts with the specified consecutive string, the match of this rule is successful.
= It is used to compare both the strings and numbers. When the real string or number is completely the same as the specified one, the match of this rule is 
successful.
!= It is used to compare both the strings and numbers. When the real string 
or number is not the same as the specified one, the match of this rule is successful.
> It is used to compare the numbers, such as SNR, Tx rate, CPU load and Memory usage. When the real number is larger than the specified one, the 
match of this rule is successful.
< It is used to compare the numbers, such as SNR, Tx rate, CPU load and 
Memory usage. When the real number is smaller than the specified one, the match of this rule is successful.
Manual Grouping
Follow the steps below to create a new group and add the specific devices to this group:
1. Go to the Device page. Click Manual Grouping and click 
  .
 21
2. In the pop-up window, specify a name for the new group and click OK.
3. Select your desired devices to be added to the new group. Click 
 , move your mouse to Add to 
Group and select the new group.
4. Then the selected devices will be added to the new group. You can enter the group to check the 
configuration result.

wireless modes: 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11b/g and 802.11b/g/n. You 
are recommended to set the 11b/g/n mixed mode, and all of 802.11b, 802.11g 
and 802.11n wireless stations can connect to the device. 
CPE510/CPE520/WBS510 has a frequency band of 5GHz, supporting 802.11a, 
802.11n and 802.11a/n modes. We suggest to set in 11a/n mode, allowing both 
802.11a and 802.11n wireless stations to access the device.
Channel Width Select the channel width of the device. Options include 5MHz, 10MHz, 20MHz 
and 20/40MHz. According to IEEE 802.11n standard, using a channel width of 40MHz can increase wireless throughput. However, you may choose lower 
bandwidth due to the following reasons:
Increase the available number of channels within the limited total bandwidth.To avoid interference from overlapping channels occupied by other devices in 
the environment.
Lower bandwidth can concentrate higher transmit power, increasing stability of 
wireless links over long distances.
Subject to the channel width of root AP in Client/ Bridge/ Repeater/ Client Router 
operation modes.
Max Tx Rate Select the maximum data transmission rate.
channel/frequency Select the channel used by the device to improve wireless performance. This setting is only available in the modes of Access Point and AP Router. We 
recommend you use the Spectrum Analysis tool to select a proper channel.
Transmission Power Specify the transmit power value. The valid values vary with the prodct models 
and regions.
MAXtream Enable or disable MAXtream. This feature is only available in the modes of 
Access Point and AP Router. MAXtream is a proprietary technology of TP-
Link for Wi-Fi system. It is based on TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) so 
that data streams are transmitted in strict order. MAXtream aims to maximize throughput and minimize latency especially in a multi-STAs circumstance. 
“Hidden nodes” problem can also be eliminated with MAXtream enabled. We 
recommend you turn on MAXtream in a large scale wireless deployment to achieve better performance.
Note: MAXtream Technology is only compatible with Pharos series products. 
You cannot connect other Wi-Fi devices to an AP with MAXtream enabled. 29
Distance Settings Specify the distance between AP and Station. If this device serves as a client, 
the value is the distance between this device and the root AP. If this device 
serves as an AP, the value is the distance between the farthest client and this 
AP.
You can manually enter the value or enable the Auto option.
Manual: Enter the distance manually in the input box. The value is limited to 
0-200km, and we recommend you set the value to 110% of the real distance.
Auto: Check the Auto option, then the system will dynamically detect the 
distance. This function is available only when the distance is less than xx kilometers. The value xx varies according to the channel width you set. CPE210 
does not support this option.
AP Isolation Enable or disable AP Isolation. AP Isolation is used to isolate all wireless stations 
connected to this device so that they cannot communicate with each other. This 
function will be disabled if WDS/Bridge is enabled.

Overview
Omada series products provide wireless coverage solutions for small-medium business and 
households. They can either work independently as standalone APs or be centrally managed 
by Omada Software Controller, Omada Hardware Controller, or Omada Cloud-Based Controller, 
providing a flexible, richly-functional but easily configured wireless network for small-medium 
business and households. 4
 1  Quick Start
This chapter introduces how to build a wireless network using the EAPs and how to 
complete the basic settings. Follow the steps below:
1.1 Determine the Management Method
1.2 Connect Network Devices
1.3 Complete Initial Setup
  5
1.1 Determine the Management Method
Before building your network, choose a proper method to manage your EAPs. You have 
the following two options:
 ■Controller Mode
If you want to manage a large-scale network centrally, choose Controller Mode. In 
Controller Mode, you can configure and monitor mass EAPs, switches, and gateways 
via Omada SDN Controller. For detailed instructions, go to the Support Page of Omada 
Controller and download the User Guide.
 ■Standalone Mode
If you want to manage only a few EAPs, choose Standalone Mode. In Standalone Mode, 
you can singly configure and monitor your EAPs via Omada APP or a web browser, and 
each EAP has its own management page.
This chapter introduces how to start configuring the EAP in Standalone Mode.
Note:
 •Standalone Mode is inaccessible while the EAP is managed by a controller. T o turn the EAP back 
to Standalone Mode, you can forget the EAP on the controller or reset the EAP .
 •T o make your EAPs discovered by the controller, you need to configure 7.2 Configure Controller 
Settings  in certain scenarios. 6

 •Method 3: Set Up via a Web Browser (for a PC connected to EAP via Ethernet)
1. Get the IP address of the EAP. There are two methods.
• Using the DHCP Client List of the Gateway/Router
Log in to your gateway/router which acts as the DHCP server. In the DHCP client list, 
find the IP address of your EAP according to its MAC address. The MAC address can 
be found at the bottom of the EAP. In the following figure, for example, the IP address of 
the EAP is 192.168.0.118.
Note:
When the DHCP server is not available in your network, the EAP has the DHCP fallback IP 
address, which is 192.168.0.254 by default.
• Using the EAP Discovery Utility 13
Go to https://www.tp-link.com/download/EAP-Controller.html#EAP_Discovery_Tool to 
download, install and launch EAP Discovery Utility on your PC. EAP Discovery Utility can 
scan all EAPs in the same network segment, and find the IP address of the EAP. In the 
following figure, for example, the IP address of the EAP is 192.168.0.5.
Note:
Some EAP models only works with certain software version of Discovery Utility. If your Discovery 
Utility can’t discover your EAP anyway, try a different software version.
2. Launch a web browser and enter the IP address of the EAP in the address bar. The login 
page will appear. By default, both the username and password are admin.
Tips:
T o facilitate access to the EAP , you can set a static IP address for the EAP and remember it well or 
write it down. But make sure that this IP address is not being used by other devices in the same LAN. 
For detailed instructions about how to set a static IP address for the EAP , refer to 6.2 Manage the 
IP Address of the EAP . 14
3. Follow the step-by-step web instructions to complete the initial setup.

3.1 Configure the Wireless Parameters
To configure the wireless parameters, go to the Wireless > Wireless Settings page.
 19
For a multi-band EAP, you can click each band to enable Wireless Radio and configure 
wireless parameters. 
Demonstrated with 2.4GHz, the following sections introduce these contents: 3.1.1 
Configure SSIDs  and 3.1.2 Configure Wireless Advanced Settings .
3.1.1  Configure SSIDs
SSID (Service Set Identifier) is used as an identifier for a wireless LAN, and is commonly 
called as the “network name“. Clients can find and access the wireless network through 
the SSID. For one EAP, you can build up to eight SSIDs per frequency band.
Follow the steps below to create an SSID on the EAP:
1. If your EAP is a dual-band device, click 
  to choose a frequency band on 
which the new SSID will be created. 20
2. Click 
  to add a new SSID on the chosen band.
Tips:
Y ou can also click 
  to edit the specific SSID which already exists in the list. And you can click 
  
to delete the SSID in the list.
3. Configure the following required parameters for this SSID:
SSID Specify a name for the wireless network.
SSID Broadcast With the option enabled, EAP will broadcast the SSID to the nearby 
hosts, so that those hosts can find the wireless network identified by 
this SSID. If this option is disabled, users must enter the SSID manually 
to connect to the EAP.
Security Mode Select the security mode of the wireless network. There are four 
options:
None : Clients can access the wireless network without authentication.
WEP / WPA-Enterprise / WAP-Personal : Clients need to pass the 
authentication before accessing the wireless network. 
For 6GHz:
Enhanced Open : Enhanced Open is a Wi-Fi Alliance certification that 
preserves the convenience open networks offer while reducing some of 
the risks associated with accessing an unsecured network.
WPA3-Enterprise / WAP3-Personal : Clients need to pass the 
authentication before accessing the wireless network. 
For network security, we recommend that you encrypt your wireless 
network. The following sections will introduce how to configure these 
security modes.
Guest Network With this option enabled, guest network will block clients from reaching 
any private IP subnet.
Rate Limit With this option enabled, the download and upload rate of each client  
which connects to the SSID will be limited to balance bandwidth usage. 
You can limit the download and upload rate for some specific clients by 
configuring rate limit in client list, refer to  View Client Information  to 
get more details.
Note that the download and upload rate will be limited to the smaller 
value if you set the limit value both in SSID and client configuration.  
4. Click OK to create the SSID.
Following is the detailed instructions about how to configure WEP , WPA-Enterprise , WPA-
Personal , WPA3-Enterprise , and  WAP3-Personal 21
 •WEP (for certain models)
WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is a traditional encryption method. It has been proved 
that WEP has security flaws and can easily be cracked, so WEP cannot provide effective 
protection for wireless networks. Since WPA-Personal and WPA-Enterprise are much 
safer than WEP, we recommend that you choose WPA-Personal or WPA-Enterprise if your 
clients also support them.
Note:
WEP is not supported in 802.11n mode or 802.11ac mode. If WEP is applied in 802.11n, 802.11 ac 
or 802.11n/ac mixed mode, the clients may not be able to access the wireless network. If WEP is 
applied in 802.11b/g/n mode (2.4GHz) or 802.11a/n (5GHz), the EAP may work at a low transmission 
rate.
The following table detailedly introduces how to configure each item:
Type Select the authentication type for WEP.
Auto:  The EAP can select Open System or Shared Key automatically based 
on the wireless capability and request of the clients.
Open System: Clients can pass the authentication and associate with 
the wireless network without password. However, correct password is 
necessary for data transmission.
Shared Key: Clients have to input the correct password to pass the 
authentication, otherwise the clients cannot associate with the wireless 
network or transmit data.
Key Selected Select one key to specify. You can configure four keys at most.
WEP Key Format Select ASCII or Hexadecimal as the WEP key format.
ASCII: With this format selected, the WEP key can be any combination of 
keyboard characters of the specified length.
Hexadecimal: With this format selected, the WEP key can be any 
combination of hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, A-F) with the specified length. 22
Key Type Select the WEP key length for encryption.
64Bit: Enter 10 hexadecimal digits or 5 ASCII characters.
128Bit: Enter 26 hexadecimal digits or 13 ASCII characters.
152Bit: Enter 32 hexadecimal digits or 16 ASCII characters.
Key Value Enter the WEP keys. The length and valid characters are determined by the 
key format and key type.
 •WPA-Enterprise (for certain models)
WPA-Enterprise (Wi-Fi Protected Access-Enterprise) is a safer encryption method 
compared with WEP and WPA-Personal. It requires a RADIUS server to authenticate the 
clients via 802.1X and EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol). WPA-Enterprise can 
generate different passwords for different clients, which ensures higher network security. 
But it also costs more to maintain the network, so it is more suitable for business networks.
The following table introduces how to configure each item:
Version Select the version of WPA-Enterprise according to your needs. If you 
select WPA/WPA2-Enterprise, the EAP automatically decides whether 
to use WPA-Enterprise or WPA2-Enterprise during the authentication 
process. 23
Encryption Select the Encryption type. Note that some encryption type is only 
available under certain circumstances.
Auto: The default setting is Auto and the EAP will select TKIP or AES 
automatically based on the client device’s request.
TKIP: Temporal Key Integrity Protocol. TKIP is not supported in 
802.11n mode, 802.11ac mode or 802.11n/ac mixed mode. If TKIP is 
applied in 802.11n, 802.11 ac or 802.11n/ac mixed mode, the clients 
may not be able to access the wireless network. If TKIP is applied in 
11b/g/n mode (2.4GHz) or 11a/n mode(5GHz), the device may work at 
a low transmission rate.
AES: Advanced Encryption Standard. It is securer than TKIP.
RADIUS Server IP Enter the IP address of the RADIUS Server.
RADIUS Port Enter the port number of the RADIUS Server.
RADIUS Password Enter the shared secret key of the RADIUS server.
RADIUS Accounting Enable or disable RADIUS accounting feature.

Update Interval.
Interim Update 
IntervalWith Interim Update enabled, specify the appropriate duration 
between updates for EAPs. The default duration is 600 seconds.
Group Key Update
PeriodSpecify an update period of the encryption key. The update period 
instructs how often the EAP should change the encryption key. 0 
means that the encryption key does not change at anytime. 24
 •WPA-Personal (for certain models)
WPA-Personal is based on a pre-shared key. It is characterized by high safety and simple 
settings, so it is mostly used by common households and small businesses.
The following table introduces how to configure each item:
Version Select the version of WPA-Personal according to your needs. If you select 
WPA/WPA2-PSK, the EAP automatically decides whether to use WPA-PSK 
or WPA2-PSK during the authentication process.
Encryption Select the Encryption type. Note that some encryption type is only available 
under certain circumstances.
Auto: The default setting is Auto and the EAP will select TKIP or AES 
automatically based on the client device’s request.
TKIP:  Temporal Key Integrity Protocol. TKIP is not supported in 802.11n 
mode, 802.11ac mode or 802.11n/ac mixed mode. If TKIP is applied in 
802.11n, 802.11 ac or 802.11n/ac mixed mode, the clients may not be able 
to access the wireless network. If TKIP is applied in 11b/g/n mode (2.4GHz) 
or 11a/n mode(5GHz), the device may work at a low transmission rate.
AES: Advanced Encryption Standard. It is securer than TKIP.

3.1.2  Configure Wireless Advanced Settings
Proper wireless parameters can improve the performance of your wireless network. 
This section introduces how to configure the advanced wireless parameters of the EAP, 
including  Radio Setting ,  Load Balance ,  Airtime Fairness  and   More Settings .
Radio Setting
Radio settings directly control the behavior of the radio in the EAP and its interaction with 
the physical medium; that is, how and what type of signal the EAP emits.
Note:
For Sub-APs, the Wireless Mode, Channel Width, and Channel will follow the settings of their Main 
AP and cannot be edited. 
 27
Select the frequency band and configure the following parameters.
Wireless Mode Select the IEEE 802.11 mode the radio uses. 
 •For 2.4GHz:
802.11b/g/n/ax/be mixed is recommended so that all of 802.11b, 802.11g, 
802.11n, 802.11ax, and 802.11be clients operating in the 2.4GHz frequency 
can connect to the AP. Note that some devices may not support 802.11ax 
and 802.11be; in this case, select the one with most types mixed.
 •For 5GHz:
802.11a/n/ac/ax/be mixed is recommended so that all of 802.11a, 802.11n, 
802.11ac, 802.11ax, and 802.11be clients operating in the 5GHz frequency 
can connect to the AP. Note that some devices may not support 802.11ax 
and 802.11be; in this case, select the one with most types mixed.
 •For 6GHz:
802.11ax/be mixed is recommended so that all of 802.11ax and 802.11be 
clients operating in the 6GHz frequency can connect to the AP. Note that 
Wi-Fi 6E devices support 802.11ax only.
Channel Width Select the channel width of the AP. The available options differ among 
different APs.
We recommend you set the channel bandwidth to Auto to improve the 
transmission speed. However, you may choose a lower bandwidth due to 
the following reasons:
 •To increase the available number of channels within the limited total 
bandwidth.
 •To avoid interference from overlapping channels occupied by other 
devices in the environment.
 •Lower bandwidth can concentrate higher transmit power, increasing 
stability of wireless links over long distances.
Channel Limit Check the box to enable the Channel Limit function. With this function 
enabled, the wireless frequency 5150MHz~5350MHz will be disabled. This 
function can influence the available options in Channel.
This feature is only available on certain devices. To check whether your 
device supports this feature, refer to the actual web interface.
Channel Select the channel used by the EAP. For example, 1/2412MHz means that 
the channel is 1 and the frequency is 2412MHz.
By default, the channel is automatically selected, and we recommend that 
you keep the default setting. 28
Tx Power (EIRP) Specify the transmit power value.
If this value is set to be larger than the maximum transmit power that is 
allowed by the local regulation, the regulated maximum transmit power will 
be applied in the actual situation.
Note:  In most cases, it is unnecessary to use the maximum transmit power. 
Specifying a larger transmit power than needed may cause interference to 
the neighborhood. Also it consumes more power and reduces longevity of 
the device.
Load Balance
With the Load Balance feature, you can limit the maximum number of clients who can 
access the EAP. In this way, you can achieve rational use of network resources.
Follow the steps below to configure Load Balance:
1. Click 
  to choose a frequency band on which the load balance feature will 
take effect.
2. Check the box to enable Load Balance.
3. Specify the maximum number of clients who can connect to the EAP at the same time. 
While the number of connected clients has reached the limit and there are more clients 
requesting to access the network, the EAP will disconnect those with weaker signals.
4. Click Save.
Airtime Fairness
Note:
Airtime Fairness is only available on certain devices. T o check whether your device supports this 
feature, refer to the actual web interface.
With Airtime Fairness enabled, each client connected to the EAP can get the same amount 
of time to transmit data, avoiding low-data-rate clients to occupy too much network 
bandwidth. 29
Compared with the relatively new client devices, some legacy client devices support 
slower wireless rate. If they communicate with the same EAP, the slower clients take more 
time to transmit and receive data compared with the faster clients. As a result, the overall 
wireless throughput of the network decreases. 
Therefore we recommend you check the box to enable this function under multi-
rate wireless networks. In this way, the faster clients can get more time for the data 
transmission and the network overall throughput can be improved.
Note:
With Airtime Fairness enabled, 50 wireless clients at most can connect to the EAP in 2.4GHz band.
More Settings
Proper wireless parameters can improve the network’s stability, reliability and 
communication efficiency.
The following table introduces how to configure each item:
Beacon Interval Beacons are transmitted periodically by the EAP to announce the presence 
of a wireless network for the clients. Beacon Interval determines the time 
interval of the beacons sent by the EAP.
You can specify a value between 40 and 100ms. The default is 100ms. 30
DTIM Period The DTIM (Delivery Traffic Indication Message) is contained in some 
Beacon frames. It indicates whether the EAP has buffered data for client 
devices. The DTIM Period  indicates how often the clients served by this 
EAP should check for buffered data still on the EAP awaiting pickup.
You can specify the value between 1-255 Beacon Intervals. The default 
value is 1, indicating that clients check for buffered data at every beacon. 
An excessive DTIM interval may reduce the performance of multicast 
applications, so we recommend you keep the default value.
RTS Threshold RTS/CTS (Request to Send/Clear to Send) is used to improve the data 
transmission efficiency of the network with hidden nodes, especially when 
there are lots of large packets to be transmitted.
When the size of a data packet is larger than the RTS Threshold, the RTS/
CTS mechanism will be activated. With this mechanism activated, before 
sending a data packet, the client will send an RTS packet to the EAP to 
request data transmitting. And then the EAP will send CTS packet to inform 
other clients to delay their data transmitting. In this way, packet collisions 
can be avoided.
For a busy network with hidden nodes, a low threshold value will help 
reduce interference and packet collisions. But for a not-so-busy network, a 
too low threshold value will cause bandwidth wasting and reduce the data 
throughput. The recommended and default value is 2347 bytes.
Fragmentation 
ThresholdThe fragmentation function can limit the size of packets transmitted over 
the network. If the size of a packet exceeds the Fragmentation Threshold, 
the fragmentation function is activated and the packet will be fragmented 
into several packets.
Fragmentation helps improve network performance if properly configured. 
However, a too low fragmentation threshold may result in poor wireless 
performance caused by the extra work of dividing up and reassembling 
of frames and increased message traffic. The recommended and default 
value is 2346 bytes.
OFDMA OFDMA enables multiple users to transmit data simultaneously, and thus 
greatly improves speed and efficiency. Only when your clients also support 
OFDMA, can you fully enjoy the benefits.
This feature is only available on certain devices. To check whether your 
device supports this feature, refer to the actual web interface.
Non-PSC 
ChannelPreferred Scanning Channels (PSCs) are channels that are prioritized 
within the 6 GHz WiFi band for efficient connectivity. Some clients may not 
discover 6GHz networks using non-PSC channels. 
This feature is only available on certain devices. To check whether your 
device supports this feature, refer to the actual web interface. 31
3.1.3  Configure the MLO Network (Only for Wi-Fi 7 Devices)

Source MAC Address and Destination Port, you can simply keep them as empty or configure them 
according to your actual needs.
3. Click OK to add the policy. 43
3.3 Configure VLAN
Wireless VLAN is used to set VLANs for the wireless networks. With this feature, the EAP 
can work together with the switches supporting 802.1Q VLAN. Traffic from the clients 
in different wireless networks is added with different VLAN tags according to the VLAN 
settings of the wireless networks. Then the wireless clients in different VLANs cannot 
directly communicate with each other. Note that the traffic from the wired clients will not 
be added with VLAN tags.
To configure VLAN for the wireless network, go to the Wireless > VLAN page.
Follow the steps below to configure VLAN on this page.
1. Select the specific SSID in the list to configure the VLAN.
2. In the VLAN column and select Enable to enable the VLAN function on the SSID. 
3. Specify the VLAN ID for the wireless network in the VLAN ID column. Every VLAN ID 
represents a different VLAN. It supports maximum 8 VLANs per frequency band. The 
VLAN ID range is 0 to 4094. 0 is used to disable VLAN tagging.
4. Click Save. 44
3.4 Configure MAC Filtering
MAC Filtering is used to allow or block the clients with specific MAC addresses to access 
the network. With this feature you can effectively control clients’ access to the wireless 
network according to your needs.
To configure MAC Filtering, go to the Wireless > MAC Filtering page.
Follow the steps below to configure MAC Filtering on this page:
1. In the Settings section, check the box to enable MAC Filtering, and click Save.
 45
2. In the Station MAC Group  section, click 
   and the following page will 
appear.
1 ) Click  
  and specify a name for the MAC group to be created. Click OK. 
You can create up to eight MAC groups.
2 ) Select a MAC group in the group list (the color of the selected one will change to 
blue). Click 
  to add group members to the MAC group. Specify 
the MAC address of the host and click OK. In the same way, you can add more MAC 
addresses to the selected MAC group.
3. In the MAC Filtering Association section, configure the filtering rule. For each SSID, you 
can select a MAC group in the MAC Group Name  column and select the filtering rule 
(Allow/Deny) in the Action column. Click Save. 46
For example, the following configuration means that the hosts in Group 2 are denied to 
access the SSID SSID-1 on the 2.4GHz band and allowed to access the SSID SSID-2 on 
the 5GHz band.
 47
3.5 Configure Scheduler
With the Scheduler feature, the EAP or its wireless network can automatically turn on or 
off at the time you set. For example, you can schedule the radio to operate only during the 
office working time to reduce power consumption.
To configure Scheduler, go to the Wireless > Scheduler page.
Follow the steps below to configure Scheduler on this page:
1. In the Settings section, check the box to enable Scheduler and select the Association 
Mode. There are two modes: Associated with SSID (the scheduler profile will be applied 
to the specific SSID) and Associated with AP (the profile will be applied to all SSIDs on 
the EAP). Then click Save.
 48
2. In the Scheduler Profile Configuration section, click 
 and the following 
page will appear.
1 ) Click 
  and specify a name for the profile to be created. Click OK. You 
can create up to eight profiles.
2 ) Select a profile in the list (the color of the selected one will change to blue). Click 
 to add time range items to the profile. Specify the Day, Start Time and 
End Time of the time range, and click OK.
Tips:
Y ou can add up to eight time range items for one profile. If there are several time range items in one 
profile, the time range of this profile is the sum of all of these time ranges. 49
3. In the Scheduler Association section, configure the scheduler rule. There are two 
association modes:  Association with SSID  and  Association with AP . The following 
sections introduce how to configure each mode.
 ■Association with SSID
If you select Association with SSID in step 1, the Scheduler Association table will 
display all the SSIDs on the EAP. For each SSID, you can select a profile in the Profile 
Name column and select the scheduler rule (Radio On/Radio Off) in the Action column. 
Then click Save.
For example, the following configuration means that during the time range defined in 
Profile2, the radio of SSID SSID-1 is on and the radio of SSID SSID-2 is off.
 ■Association with AP
If you select Association with AP in step 1, the Scheduler Association table will display 
the name and MAC address of the EAP. Select a profile in the Profile Name column and 
select the scheduler rule (Radio On/Radio Off) in the Action column. Then click Save.
For example, the following configuration means that during the time range defined in 
Profile2, the radio of all SSIDs on the EAP is on.
 50
3.6 Configure Band Steering
A client device that is capable of communicating on multiple frequency bands will typically 
connect to the 2.4GHz band. However, if too many client devices are connected to an AP 
on the same band, the efficiency of communication will be diminished. Band Steering can 
steer multi-band clients to different bands to greatly improve the network quality.
To configure Band Steering, go to the Wireless > Band Steering page.
Band Steering Configure the Band Steering function.
Disable: The AP will not steer clients.
Prefer 5GHz/6GHz: The AP will steer clients to the 5GHz and 6GHz 
in priority.
Balance: The AP will balance client connections among different 
bands. 51
3.7 Configure QoS
Quality of service (QoS) is used to optimize the throughput and performance of the EAP 
when handling differentiated wireless traffic, such as Voice-over-IP (VoIP), other types of 
audio, video, streaming media, and traditional IP data.
In QoS configuration, you should set parameters on the transmission queues for 
different types of wireless traffic and specify minimum and maximum wait time for data 
transmission. In normal use, we recommend that you keep the default values.
To configure QoS, go to the Wireless > QoS page.
Follow the steps below to configure QoS on this page:
1. Click 
  to choose a frequency band to be configured. 52
2. Check the box to enable Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM). With WMM enabled, the EAP uses 
the QoS function to guarantee the high priority of the transmission of audio and video 
packets.
Note:
If 802.11n only mode is selected in 2.4GHz (or 802.11n only, 802.11ac only, or 802.11 n/ac mixed 
mode selected in 5GHz), the WMM should be enabled. If WMM is disabled, the 802.11n only mode 
cannot be selected in 2.4GHz (or 802.11n only, 802.11ac only, or 802.11 n/ac mixed mode in 5GHz).
3. In the AP EDCA Parameters section, configure the AP EDCA ((Enhanced Distributed 
Channel Access) parameters. AP EDCA parameters affect traffic flowing from the EAP 
to the client station. The following table detailedly explains these parameters.
The following table detailedly explains these parameters:
Queue Displays the transmission queue. By default, the priority from high to 
low is Data 0, Data 1, Data 2, and Data 3. The priority may be changed if 
you reset the EDCA parameters.
Data 0 (Voice): Highest priority queue, minimum delay. Time-sensitive 
data such as VoIP and streaming media are automatically sent to this 
queue.
Data 1 (Video): High priority queue, minimum delay. Time-sensitive 
video data is automatically sent to this queue.
Data 2 (Best Effort): Medium priority queue, medium throughput and 
delay. Most traditional IP data is sent to this queue.
Data 3 (Background): Lowest priority queue, high throughput. Bulk data 
that requires maximum throughput and is not time-sensitive is sent to 
this queue (FTP data, for example).
Arbitration Inter- 
Frame SpaceA wait time for data frames. The wait time is measured in slots. Valid 
values are from 0 to 15. 53
Minimum 
Contention 
WindowA list to the algorithm that determines the initial random backoff wait 
time (window) for retry of a transmission.
This value cannot be higher than the value of Maximum Contention 
Window.
Maximum 
Contention 
WindowThe upper limit (in milliseconds) for the doubling of the random backoff 
value. This doubling continues until either the data frame is sent or the 
Maximum Contention Window size is reached.
This value must be higher than the value of Minimum Contention 
Window.
Maximum Burst Maximum Burst specifies the maximum burst length allowed for 
packet bursts on the wireless network. A packet burst is a collection of 
multiple frames transmitted without header information. The decreased 
overhead results in higher throughput and better performance.
4. In the Station EDCA Parameters section, configure the station EDCA (Enhanced 
Distributed Channel Access) parameters. Station EDCA parameters affect traffic 
flowing from the client station to the EAP.
The following table detailedly explains these parameters:
Queue Displays the transmission queue. By default, the priority from high to 
low is Data 0, Data 1, Data 2, and Data 3. The priority may be changed if 
you reset the EDCA parameters.
Data 0 (Voice): Highest priority queue, minimum delay. Time-sensitive 
data such as VoIP and streaming media are automatically sent to this 
queue.
Data 1 (Video): High priority queue, minimum delay. Time-sensitive 
video data is automatically sent to this queue.
Data 2 (Best Effort): Medium priority queue, medium throughput and 
delay. Most traditional IP data is sent to this queue.
Data 3 (Background): Lowest priority queue, high throughput. Bulk data 
that requires maximum throughput and is not time-sensitive is sent to 
this queue (FTP data, for example). 54
Arbitration Inter- 
Frame SpaceA wait time for data frames. The wait time is measured in slots. Valid 
values are from 0 to 15.
Minimum 
Contention 
WindowA list to the algorithm that determines the initial random backoff wait 
time (window) for retry of a transmission.
This value cannot be higher than the value of Maximum Contention 
Window.
Maximum 
Contention 
WindowThe upper limit (in milliseconds) for the doubling of the random backoff 
value. This doubling continues until either the data frame is sent or the 
Maximum Contention Window size is reached.
This value must be higher than the value of Minimum Contention 
Window.
TXOP Limit The TXOP Limit is a station EDCA parameter and only applies to traffic 
flowing from the client station to the EAP.
The Transmission Opportunity (TXOP) is an interval of time, in 
milliseconds, when a WME (Wireless Multimedia Extensions) client 
station has the right to initiate transmissions onto the wireless medium 
(WM) towards the EAP. The valid values are multiples of 32 between 0 
and 8192.
5. Choose whether to enable the following two options according to your need.
The following table detailedly explains these options:
No Acknowledgment With this option enabled, the EAP would not acknowledge frames 
with QosNoAck. No Acknowledgment is recommended if VoIP 
phones access the network through the EAP.
Unscheduled 
Automatic Power Save 
DeliveryAs a power management method, it can greatly improve the 
energy-saving capacity of clients.
6. Click Save. 55
3.8 Configure Rogue AP Detection
A Rogue AP is an access point that is installed on a secure network without explicit 
authorization from the network administrator. With Rogue AP Detection, the EAP can scan 
all channels to detect the nearby APs and display the detected APs in the Detected Rogue 
AP list. If the specific AP is known as safe, you can move it to the Trusted APs list. Also, you 
can backup and import the Trusted AP list as needed.
Note:
The Rogue AP Detection feature is only used for collecting information of the nearby wireless 
network and does not impact the detected APs, no matter what operations you have executed in 
this feature.
To configure Rogue AP Detection, go to the Wireless > Rogue AP Detection page.
 56
Detect Rogue APs and Move the Rogue APs to the Trusted AP List

7.3 Configure the System Time
System time is the standard time for Scheduler and other time-based functions. The EAP 
supports the basic system time settings and the Daylight Saving Time (DST) feature.
To configure the system time, go to the System > Time Settings page.
The following two sections introduce how to configure the basic system time settings and 
the Daylight Saving Time feature. 107
Configure the System Time
In the Time Settings section, you can configure the system time. There are three methods 
to set the system time:  Set the System Time Manually ,  Acquire the System Time From an 
NTP Server , and  Synchronize the System Time with PC’s Clock .
Determine the way of setting the system time and follow the steps below to complete the 
configurations:
 •Set the System Time Manually
To set the system time manually, follow the steps below:
1. Configure the following three options on the page: Time Zone, Date and Time.
Time Zone Select your time zone from the drop-down list. Here GMT means 
Greenwich Mean Time.
Date Specify the current date in the format MM/DD/YYYY. MM means month, 
DD means day and YYYY means year.
For example: 06/01/2017.
Time Specify the current time in the format HH/MM/SS. HH means hour, MM 
means minute and SS means second.
It uses 24-hour system time. For example: 14:36:21.
2. Click Save.
Note:
The system time set manually will be lost after the EAP is rebooted. 
 •Acquire the System Time From an NTP Server
To get the system time from an NTP server, follow the steps below:
1. Build an NTP server on your network and make sure that it is reachable by the EAP. Or 
you can simply find an NTP server on the internet and get its IP address. 108
Note:
If you use an NTP server on the internet, make sure that the gateway address is set correctly on the 
EAP . Otherwise, the EAP cannot get the system time from the NTP server successfully. T o set the 
gateway address, refer to 3.1 Configure the Wireless Parameters .
2. Specify the NTP server for the EAP. If you have two NTP servers, you can set one of 
them as the primary NTP server, and the other as the secondary NTP server. Once the 
primary NTP server is down, the EAP can get the system time from the secondary NTP 
server.
Primary NTP 
ServerEnter the IP address of the primary NTP server.
Note:  If you have only one NTP server on your network, enter the IP 
address of the NTP server in this field.
Secondary NTP 
ServerEnter the IP address of the secondary NTP server.
3. Click the button 
  and the acquired system time will be displayed in the Date  
and Time fields.
4. Click Save.
 •Synchronize the System Time with PC’s Clock
To synchronize the system time with the clock of your currently logged-in host, 
follow the steps below:
1. Click the button 
  and the synchronized system time will be displayed 
in the Date and Time fields.
2. Click Save.
Note:
The system time synchronized with PC’s clock will be lost after the EAP is rebooted.  109
Configure Daylight Saving Time
Daylight saving time is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that 
evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. The EAP provides 
daylight saving time configuration.
Follow the steps below to configure daylight saving time:
1. Check the box to enable Daylight Saving.
2. Select the mode of daylight saving time. Three modes are available: Predefined Mode, 
Recurring Mode and Date Mode.
3. Configure the related parameters of the selected mode.
 ■Predefined Mode
If you select Predefined Mode, choose your region from the drop-down list and the EAP 
will use the predefined daylight saving time of the selected region.
There are four regions provided: USA, European, Austrilia and New Zealand. The 
following table introduces the predefined daylight saving time of each region.
USA From 2: 00 a.m. on the Second Sunday in March to 2:00 a.m. on the First 
Sunday in November.
European From 1: 00 a.m. on the Last Sunday in March to 1:00 a.m. on the Last 
Sunday in October.
Australia From 2:00 a.m. on the First Sunday in October to 3:00 a.m. on the First 
Sunday in April.
New Zealand From 2: 00 a.m. on the Last Sunday in September to 3:00 a.m. on the 
First Sunday in April. 110
 ■Recurring Mode
If you select Recurring Mode, manually specify a cycle time range for the daylight saving 
time of the EAP. This configuration will be used every year.
The following table introduces how to configure the cycle time range.
Time Offset Specify the time to set the clock forward by.
Start Specify the start time of daylight saving time. The interval between the 
start time and end time should be more than 1 day and less than 1 year 
(365 days).
End Specify the end time of daylight saving time. The interval between the 
start time and end time should be more than 1 day and less than 1 year 
(365 days).
 ■Date Mode
If you select Date Mode, manually specify an absolute time range for the daylight saving 
time of the EAP. This configuration will be used only once.
The following table introduces how to configure the absolute time range.
Time Offset Specify the time to set the clock forward by.
Start Specify the start time of daylight saving time. The interval between the 
start time and end time should be more than 1 day and less than 1 year 
(365 days).
End Specify the end time of daylight saving time. The interval between the 
start time and end time should be more than 1 day and less than 1 year 
(365 days).
4. Click Save. 111
7.4 Reboot and Reset the EAP
You can reboot and reset the EAP according to your need.

 8  Application Example
This chapter provides an application example about how to establish and manage a EAP 
wireless network:
A restaurant wants to provide the wireless internet access for the employees and guests. 
The restaurant now has a router, a switch, a dual-band EAP and a computer. Follow the 
steps below to establish the wireless network:
8.1 Determine the Network Requirements
8.2 Build the Network Topology
8.3 Log in to the EAP
8.4 Configure the EAP
8.5 Test the Network 115
8.1 Determine the Network Requirements
Before starting to build the network, we need to first analyze and determine the network 
requirements. In this restaurant example, the network requirements are as follows:
• On both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, there are two SSIDs needed: one for the restaurant 
employees and one for the guests.
• In order to advertise the restaurant, the Portal feature needs to be configured on the 
SSIDs for the guests. In this way, the guests who have passed the portal authentication 
will be redirected to the restaurant’s official website http://www.restaurant1.com.
• The employees of the restaurant can use the correct password to access the internet 
and do not need to pass the portal authentication. For security, the SSIDs for the 
employees should be encrypted with WPA2-PSK.
• To reduce power consumption, the Scheduler feature needs to be configured. The radio 
should operate only during the working time (9:00 am to 22:00 pm). 116
8.2 Build the Network Topology
Build the network topology as the following figure shows.
EAPManagement HostSwitchRouter (DHCP Se rver)
LAN: 192.168.88.1Internet
• The router is the gateway of the network and acts as a DHCP server to assign dynamic 
IP addresses to the management host, EAP and clients. The LAN IP of the router is 
192.168.88.1/24.
• Connect the switch to the LAN port of the router.
• Connect the management host and the EAP to the switch. The IP address mode of 
the management host and EAP is dynamic, which means that they will get dynamic IP 
addresses from the router.
Tips:
If the router has more than one LAN port, we can also respectively connect the management host 
and the EAP to the LAN ports of the router. 117
8.3 Log in to the EAP
After building the network topology, follow the steps below to log in to the web page of the 
EAP:
1. On the management host, launch the web browser and enter “192.168.88.1” in the 
address bar. Then log in to the router and find the IP address of the EAP. As the 
following figure shows, the IP address of the EAP is 192.168.88.101.
2. Enter “192.168.88.101” in the address bar to load the login page of the EAP. Type the 
default username and password (both admin) in the two fields and click LOGIN.
3. In the pop-up window, specify a new username and a new password for the user 
account. Click Next.
 118
8.4 Configure the EAP
To achieve the network requirements in this application example, we need to  Configure 
SSIDs ,  Configure Portal Authentication  and  Configure Scheduler .
Configure SSIDs
1. After Logging in to EAP, follow the step-by-step instructions to complete the basic 
configurations of creating SSIDs. Configure the SSID as “employee_2.4GHz” and 
“employee_5GHz”, specify the Password as “restaurant123abc“. Click Save.
2. Go to the Wireless > Wireless Settings page. Create SSIDs for guests on 2.4GHz. Click 
 to add a new SSID.
 119
3. The following page will appear. Configure this SSID as “guest_2.4GHz“, keep the 
Security Mode as “None” and check the box to enable the Portal feature for this SSID. 
Click OK.
4. Click 
  to enter the configuration page for the 5GHz band. Similarly to 
the configurations for the 2.4GHz band, configure another SSID for the guests on the 
5GHz band.
Configure Portal Authentication
Follow the steps below to configure portal authentication:
1. Go to the Wireless > Portal page. 120
2. Configure the portal feature as the following figure shows.
1 ) Select the SSIDs for the guests on which the portal will take effect. 
2 ) Select the Authentication Type as “Local Password” and specify the Password as 
“restaurant123”.
3 ) Configure Authentication Timeout . Here we customize the timeout as 2 hours. It 
means that guests will be logged out after they have been authenticated for 2 hours. 
To continue to use the internet service, these guests need to enter the password to 
pass the portal authentication once again.
4 ) Check the box to enable Redirect, and enter the website of the restaurant: http://
www.restaurant1.com. 121
5 ) Configure the authentication page. Specify the title and the term of use. To access 
the internet, guests need to enter the correct password in the Password field, 
accept the Term of Use, and click the Login button.
3. Click Save.
Configure Scheduler
Follow the steps below to schedule the radio to operate only during the working time (9:00 
am to 22:00 pm).
1. Go to the Wireless > Scheduler page.
2. In the Settings section, check the box to enable Scheduler, and select the Association 
Mode as “Associated with AP“. Click Save.
3. In the Scheduler Profile Configuration section, click 
 .
1 ) The following page will appear. Click 
  and specify the profile name as 
“worktime”. Click OK.
 122
2 ) Choose the newly added profile “worktime”, and click 
 . Then the item 
configuration page will appear. Specify the time range as everyday 9:00 to 22:00. 
Click OK.
4. In the Scheduler Association section, select “worktime“ in the Profile Name column 
and select “Radio On” in the Action column. Click Save.
 123
8.5 Test the Network
To ensure that the employees and guests can surf the internet via the wireless network, 
we can use a client device, such as a telephone, to test whether the SSIDs are working 
normally.
• To test the SSIDs for the employees, follow the steps below:
1 ) Enable the Wi-Fi feature of the client device.
2 ) Choose the SSID “employee_2.4GHz“ or “employee_5GHz“ among the detected 
SSIDs.
3 ) Enter the password “restaurant123abc“ to join the wireless network.
4 ) Check whether internet websites can be visited successfully.
• To test the SSIDs for the guests, follow the steps below:
1 ) Enable the Wi-Fi feature of the client device.
2 ) Choose the SSID “guest_2.4GHz“ or “guest_5GHz“ among the detected SSIDs.
3 ) The default web browser on the device will pop up and the authentication page will 
appear. Enter the password “restaurant123”, check the box to accept the term of 
use, and click the LOGIN button.
 124
Tips:
Generally, the web browser pops up automatically. But if the web browser does not pop up, we 
can manually launch the web browser and visit any http website. Then the authentication page 
will appear.
4 ) If the network is working normally, we will be redirected to the website of the 
restaurant: http://www.restaurant1.com.

Accessing the Router
CHAPTERS
1.  Determine the Management Method
2.  Web Interface AccessAccessing the Router Determine the Management Method
User Guide    31 Determine the Management Method
Before building your network, choose a proper method to manage your router based on 
your actual network situation. The router supports two configuration options: Standalone 
Mode or Controller Mode.
 ■Controller Mode
If you want to configure and manage a large-scale network centrally, which consists 
of mass devices such as access points, switches, and gateways, Controller Mode is 
recommended. In Controller Mode, the router can be centrally configured and monitored 
via Omada SDN Controller.
To prepare the router for Omada SDN Controller Management, refer to Controller 
Settings. For detailed instructions about the network topology in such situations 
and how to use Omada SDN Controller, refer to the User Guide of Omada SDN 
Controller. The guide can be found on the download center of our official website:  
https://www.tp-link.com/support/download/.
 ■Standalone Mode
If you have a relatively small-sized network and only one or just a small number of devices 
need to be managed, Standalone Mode is recommended. In Standalone Mode, you can 
access and manage the router using the GUI (Graphical User Interface, also called web 
interface in this text). The router uses two built-in web servers, HTTP server and HTTPS 
server, for user authentication.
This User Guide introduces how to configure and monitor the router in Standalone Mode.
Note:
The GUI is inaccessible while the router is managed by a controller. T o turn the router back to Standalone 
Mode and access its GUI, you can forget the router on the controller or reset the router.User Guide    4Accessing the Router Web Interface Access

 • Changing the IP address of the LAN port may affect some related functions, like the IP pool of 
the DHCP server.
3.2 Configuring the DHCP Server
You can configure an IP address pool for the DHCP server to assign IP addresses. When 
clients send requests to the DHCP server, the server will automatically assign IP addresses 
and the corresponding parameters to the clients. Moreover, if you want to reserve an IP 
address for a certain client, you can use Address Reservation to bind the IP address with 
the client’s MAC address, and the bound IP address will always be assigned to that client.

scenario where the clients apply for different IP addresses from different servers 
according to the needs. By default, it is TP-LINK.
If a client requests option 60, the server will respond a packet containing the option 
60 configured here. And then the client will compare the received option 60 with its 
own. If they are the same, the client will accept the IP address assigned by the server, 
otherwise the assigned IP address will not be accepted.
Option 138 (Optional) Specify the option 138, which can be configured as the management IP 
address of an Omada controller. If the APs in the local network request this option, 
the server will respond a packet containing this option to inform the APs of the

4 MAC Configuration
Generally, the MAC address does not need to be changed. However, in some particular 
situations, you may need to change the MAC address of the WAN port or LAN port.
 ■Configure the MAC Address of the WAN port
In the condition that your ISP has bound the account to the MAC address of the dial-up 
device, if you want to replace the dial-up device with this router, you can just set the MAC 
address of this router’s WAN port as the same as that of the previous dial-up device for a 
normal internet connection. 
 ■Configure the MAC Address of the LAN port
In a complex network where all the devices are ARP bound, if you want to replace the 
current router with this router, you can just set the MAC address of this router’s LAN port 
as the same as that of the previous router, which can avoid all the devices under this 
network node to update their ARP binding tables.

Transmission function provides multiple traffic control measures for the network. You can 
configure the transmission function according to your actual needs. 
1.2 Supported Features
The transmission module includes NAT, Bandwidth Control, Session Limit, Load Balancing 
and Routing.
NAT
NAT (Network Address Translation) is the translation between private IP and public IP. 
NAT provides a way to allow multiple private hosts to access the public network using one 
public IP at the same time, which alleviates the shortage of IP addresses. Furthermore, NAT 
strengthens the LAN (Local Area Network) security since the address of LAN host never 
appears on the internet. The router supports following NAT features:
 ■One-to-One NAT
One-to-One NAT creates a relationship between a private IP address and a public IP 
address. A device with a private IP address can be accessed through the corresponding 
valid public IP address.
 ■Virtual Servers
When you build up a server in the local network and want to share it on the internet, Virtual 
Servers can realize the service and provide it to the internet users. At the same time 
Virtual Servers can keep the local network safe as other services are still invisible from the 
internet.
 ■Port Triggering
Port Triggering is a feature used to dynamically forward traffic on a certain port to a 
specific server on the local network. When a host in the local network initiates a connection 
to the triggering port, all the external ports will be opened for subsequent connections. The 
router can record the IP address of the host, when the data from the internet returns to the 
external ports, the router can forward them to the corresponding host. Port Triggering is 
mainly applied to online games, VoIPs, video players and so on. 
 ■NAT-DMZUser Guide    62Configuring Transmission Transmission
When a PC is set to be a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) host in the local network, it is totally 
exposed to the internet, which can realize the unlimited bidirectional communication 
between internal hosts and external hosts. The DMZ host becomes a virtual server with 
all ports opened. When you are not clear about which ports to open in some special 
applications, such as IP camera and database software, you can set the PC to be a DMZ 
host.
 ■ALG
Some special protocols such as FTP, H.323, SIP, IPSec and PPTP will work properly only 
when ALG (Application Layer Gateway) service is enabled.
Bandwidth Control
You can control the bandwidth by configuring bandwidth control rules for limiting various 
data flows. In this way, the network bandwidth can be reasonably distributed and utilized. 
Session Limit
The amount of TCP and UDP sessions supported by the router is finite. If some local hosts 
transmit too many TCP and UDP sessions to the public network, the communication quality 
of the other local hosts will be affected, thus it is necessary to limit the sessions of those 
hosts.
Load Balancing
You can configure the traffic sharing mode of the WAN ports to optimize the resource 
utilization. 
Routing
You can configure policy routing rules and static routing. 
Policy routing provides a more accurate way to control the routing based on the policy 
defined by the network administrator. 
Static routing is a form of routing that is configured manually by adding non-aging entries 
into a routing table. The manually-configured routing information guides the router in 
forwarding data packets to the specific destination.Configuring Transmission NAT Configurations

3.  Configuration ExamplesUser Guide    88Configuring Firewall Firewall
1 Firewall
1.1 Overview
Firewall is used to enhance the network security. It can prevent external network threats 
from spreading to the internal network, protect the internal hosts from ARP attacks, and 
control the internal users’ access to the external network.
1.2 Supported Features
The Firewall module supports four functions: Anti ARP Spoofing, Attack Defense, and 
Access Control.
Anti ARP Spoofing
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map IP addresses to the corresponding MAC 
addresses so that packets can be delivered to their destinations. However, since ARP is 
implemented with the premise that all the hosts and routers are trusted, there are high 
security risks on real, complex networks. If attackers send ARP spoofing packets with false 
IP address-to-MAC address mapping entries, the device will update the ARP table based 
on the false ARP packets and record wrong mapping entries, which results in a breakdown 
of normal communication. 
Anti ARP Spoofing can protect the network from ARP spoofing attacks. It works based on 
the IP-MAC Binding entries. These entries record the correct one-to-one relationships 
between IP addresses and MAC addresses. When receiving an ARP packet, the router 
checks whether it matches any of the IP-MAC Binding entries. If not, the router will ignore 
the ARP packets. In this way, the router maintains the correct ARP table. 
In addition, the router provides the following two sub functions:
 ■Permitting the packets matching the IP-MAC Binding entries only and discarding other 
packets.
 ■Sending GARP packets to the hosts when it detects ARP attacks. The GARP packets 
can inform hosts of the correct ARP table, preventing their ARP tables from being 
falsified by ARP spoofing packets.
Attack Defense
Attacks on a network device can cause device or network paralysis. With the Attack 
Defense feature, the router can identify and discard various attack packets which are sent 
to the CPU, and limit the packet receiving rate. In this way, the router can protect itself and 
the connected network against malicious attacks.Configuring Firewall Firewall
User Guide    89The router provides two types of Attack Defense: Flood Defense and Packet Anomaly 
Defense. Flood Defense limits the receiving rate of the specific types of packets, and 
Packet Anomaly Defense discards the illegal packets directly.
Access Control
Access Control can filter the packets passing through the router based on the Access 
Control rules. An Access Control rule includes a filter policy and some conditions, such as 
service type, receiving interface and effective time. The router will apply the filter policy to 
the packets matching these conditions, and thus to limit network traffic, manage network 
access behaviors and more.
Access Control can prevent various network attacks, such as attacks on TCP (Transmission 
Control Protocol) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets, and can also 
manage network access behaviors, such as controlling access to the internet.User Guide    90Configuring Firewall Firewall Configuration
2 Firewall Configuration
In Firewall module, you can configure the following features:
 ■Anti ARP Spoofing
 ■Attack Defense
 ■Access Control
2.1 Anti ARP Spoofing
To complete Anti ARP Spoofing configuration, there are two steps. First, add IP-MAC 
Binding entries to the IP-MAC Binding List. Then enable Anti ARP Spoofing for these 
entries.
Note:
In case Anti ARP Spoofing causes access problems to the currently connected devices, we 
recommend that you add and verify the IP-MAC Binding entries first before enabling Anti ARP 
Spoofing.
2.1.1 Adding IP-MAC Binding Entries
You can add IP-MAC Binding entries in two ways: manually and via ARP scanning.
 ■Adding IP-MAC Binding Entries Manually
You can manually bind the IP address, MAC address and interface together on the 
condition that you have got the related information of the hosts on the network.
 ■Adding IP-MAC Binding Entries via ARP Scanning
With ARP Scanning, the router sends the ARP request packets with the specific IP field to 
the hosts. Upon receiving the ARP reply packet, the router can get the IP address, MAC 
address and connected interface of the host.
The following sections introduce these two methods in detail.Configuring Firewall Firewall Configuration
User Guide    91Adding IP-MAC Binding Entries Manually
Before adding entries manually, get the IP addresses and MAC addresses of the hosts on 
the network and make sure of their accuracy.
Choose the menu Firewall > Anti ARP Spoofing > IP-MAC Binding to load the following 
page.

Adding IP-MAC Binding Entries via ARP Scanning
If you want to get the IP addresses and MAC addresses of the hosts quickly, you can use 
ARP Scanning to facilitate your operation.
Note:
Before using this feature, make sure that your network is safe and the hosts are not suffering from 
ARP attacks at present; otherwise, you may obtain incorrect IP-MAC Binding entries. If your network

the router can protect its ARP table from being falsified by ARP spoofing packets.
2) Choose whether to enable the two sub functions. 
Permit the packets matching 
the IP-MAC Binding entries onlyWith this option enabled, when receiving a packet, the router 
will check whether the IP address, MAC address and receiving 
interface match any of the IP-MAC Binding entries. Only the 
matched packets will be forwarded. 
Send GARP packets when ARP 
attack is detectedWith this option enabled, the router will send GARP packets to the 
hosts if it detects ARP spoofing packets on the network. The GARP 
packets will inform the hosts of the correct ARP information, which 
is used to replace the wrong ARP information in the hosts.

3.1.1 Network Requirements
In the diagram below, several hosts are connected to the network via a layer 2 switch, and 
the router is the gateway of this network. Since there exists the possibility that the attacker 
will launch a series of ARP attacks, it is required to configure the router to protect itself and 
the terminal hosts from the ARP attacks.

3.1.2 Configuration Scheme
The attacker can launch three types of ARP attacks: cheating router, imitating gateway and 
cheating terminal hosts. The following section introduces the three ARP attacks and the 
corresponding solutions.
 ■Cheating Gateway
Cheating gateway attack is aimed at the router.User Guide    100Configuring Firewall Configuration Examples
The attacker pretends to be legal terminal hosts and sends fake ARP packets to the router, 
cheating the router into recording wrong ARP maps of the hosts. As a result, packets from 
the gateway cannot be correctly sent to the hosts. To protect the router from this kind of 
attack, you can configure Anti ARP Spoofing on the router.
 ■Imitating Gateway and Cheating Hosts
These two attacks are aimed at the terminal hosts.
Imitating Gateway means that the attacker imitates the gateway and sends fake ARP 
packets to the hosts. As a result, the hosts record wrong ARP map of the gateway and 
cannot send packets to the router correctly.
Cheating Hosts means that the attacker pretends to be a legal host and sends fake ARP 
packets to other hosts. As a result, the cheated hosts record an incorrect ARP map of the 
legal host and cannot send packets to legal host correctly.
To protect the hosts from the attacks above, it is recommend to take both of the 
precautions below.
 »Configure the firewall feature on the hosts. 
 »Configure the router to send GARP packets to the hosts when the router detects ARP 
attacks. The GARP packets will inform the hosts of the correct ARP maps, and the 
wrong ARP maps in the hosts will be replaced by the correct ones.
In conclusion, to protect the network from ARP attacks, we should make sure both the 
router and the hosts are configured with the relevant ARP defense features. Here we 
introduce how to configure Anti ARP Spoofing on the router. There are mainly three steps:
1) Get the IP and MAC addresses of the legal hosts and bind them to the IP-MAC Binding 
list.
2) Enable Anti ARP Spoofing.
3) Configure the router to send GARP packets when ARP attacks are detected.
3.1.3 Configuration Procedure
Follow the steps below to configure Anti ARP Spoofing on the router:
1) Choose the menu Firewall > Anti ARP Spoofing > IP-MAC Binding to load the following 
page. In the IP-MAC Binding List section, click Add.Configuring Firewall Configuration Examples

3.2.1 Network Requirements
In the diagram below, the R&D and some other departments are connected to a layer 2 
switch and access the internet via the router. To limit the acts of the R&D department users, 
such as sending emails with the exterior mailbox, it is required that the R&D users can only 
visit websites via HTTP and HTTPs on the internet at any time. For other departments, there 
is no limitation.

User Guide    1033.2.2 Configuration Scheme
To meet these requirements, we can configure Access Control rules on the router to filter 
the specific types of packets from R&D department: only the HTTP and HTTPs packets 
are allowed to be sent to the internet, and other types of packets are not allowed. The 
configuration overview is as follows:
1) Add an IP group for the R&D department in the Preferences module.
2) By default, the HTTP service type already exists, and you need to add HTTPs to the 
Service Type list in the Preferences module.
3) Create two rules to allow the HTTP and HTTPs packets from the R&D department to be 
sent to the WAN.
4) Since visiting the internet needs DNS service, add a rule to allow the DNS packets to be 
sent to the WAN. DNS service is already in the Service Type list by default.
5) Create a rule to block all packets from the R&D department to the WAN. This rule should 
have the lowest priority among all the rules.
3.2.3 Configuration Procedure
Follow the steps below to complete the configuration:
1) Choose the menu Preferences > IP Group > IP Address to load the configuration page, 
and click Add. Specify a name RD, select  IP Address Range and enter the IP address 
range of the R&D department. Click OK.

User Guide    107Figure 3-8 Configure Block Rule for ALL Services
8) Verify your configuration result. In the Access Control List, the rule with a smaller ID has 
a higher priority. Since the router matches the rules beginning with the highest priority, 
make sure the three Allow rules have the smaller ID numbers compared with the Block 
rule. In this way, the router checks whether the received packet matches the three Allow 
rules first, and only packets that do not match any of the Allow rules will be blocked.

We can configure Web Filtering to limit the website access of the specific hosts. Both 
Web Group Filtering and URL Filtering can achieve this. In this example, the configuration 
difference between Web Group Filtering and URL Filtering is as follows:
 ■In Web Group Filtering, you need to add the official website address to a web group 
before configuring the filtering rule.User Guide    118Configuring Behavior Control Configuration Examples
 ■In URL Filtering, you can directly specify the official website address in the filtering rule.
Here we take Web Group Filtering as an example. The configuration overview is as follows:
1) Add an IP group for the R&D department in the Preferences module.
2) Create a web group with the group member www.tp-link.com.
3) Add a Whitelist rule to allow the R&D department users to access www.tp-link.com.
4) Add a Blacklist rule to forbid the R&D department users from accessing all websites.

remote computers across a public WAN (Wide Area Network), such as the internet. Virtual 
indicates the VPN connection is based on the logical end-to-end connection instead of the 
physical end-to-end connection. Private indicates users can establish the VPN connection 
according to their requirements and only specific users are allowed to use the VPN 
connection. 
The core of VPN is to realize tunnel communication, which fulfills the task of data 
encapsulation, data transmission and data decompression via the tunneling protocol. 
Common tunneling protocols are Layer 2 tunneling protocol and Layer 3 tunneling 
protocol.
Depending on your network topology, there are two basic application scenarios: LAN-to-
LAN VPN and Client-to-LAN VPN.
Depending on your network topology, there are two basic application scenarios: 
LAN-to-LAN VPN and Client-to-LAN VPN.
 ■LAN-to-LAN VPN
In this scenario, different private networks are connected together via the internet. For 
example, the private networks of the branch office and head office in a company are 
located at different places. LAN-to-LAN VPN can satisfy the demand that hosts in these 
private networks need to communicate with each other. The following figure shows the 
typical network topology in this scenario.

In this scenario, the remote host is provided with secure access to the local hosts. For 
example, an employee on business can access the private network of his company 
securely. Client-to-LAN VPN can satisfy this demand. The following figure shows the typical 
network topology in this scenario.

1.2 Supported Features
The router supports Layer 2 tunneling protocol (PPTP, L2TP) and Layer 3 tunneling 
protocol (IPSec).
IPsec
IPsec (IP Security) can provide security services such as data confidentiality, data integrity 
and data origin authentication at the IP layer. IPsec uses IKEv1 (Internet Key Exchange 
version 1) to handle negotiation of protocols and algorithms based on the user-specified 
policy, and generate the encryption and authentication keys to be used by IPsec. IKEv1 
negotiation includes two phases, that is IKEv1 Phase-1 and IKEv1 Phase-2. The basic 
concepts of IPsec are as follows:
 ■Proposal
Proposal is the security suite configured manually to be applied in IPsec IKEv1 negotiation. 
Specifically speaking, it refers to hash algorithm, symmetric encryption algorithm, 
asymmetric encryption algorithm applied in IKEv1 Phase-1, and security protocol, hash 
algorithm, symmetric encryption algorithm applied in IKEv1 Phase-2. 
 ■Negotiation Mode
The negotiation mode configured for IKEv1 Phase-1 negotiation determines the role that 
the VPN router plays in the negotiation process. You can specify the negotiation mode as 
responder mode or initiator mode. 
Responder Mode: In responder mode, the VPN router responds to the requests for IKEv1 
negotiation and acts as the VPN server or the responder.User Guide    126Configuring VPN VPN
Initiator Mode: In initiator mode, the VPN router sends requests for IKEv1 negotiation and 
acts as the VPN client or the initiator.
 ■Exchange Mode
The exchange mode determines the way VPN routers negotiate in IKEv1 Phase-1. You can 
specify the exchange mode as main mode or aggressive mode. 
Main Mode: In main mode, the identification information for authentication is encrypted, 
thus enhancing security.
Aggressive Mode: In aggressive mode, less packets are exchanged, thus improving 
speed. 
 ■Authentication ID Type
The authentication ID type determines the type of authentication identifiers applied in 
IKEv1 Phase -1. It includes the local ID type and the remote ID type. The local ID indicates 
the authentication identifier sent to the other end, and the remote ID indicates that 
expected from the other end. You can specify the authentication ID type as IP address or 
name.
IP Address: The router uses the IP address for authentication.
Name: The router uses the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) for authentication.
 ■Encapsulation Mode
The encapsulation mode determines how packets transfered in the VPN tunnel are 
encapsulated. You can select tunnel mode or transport mode as the encapsulation mode. 
For most users, it is recommended to use the tunnel mode.
 ■PFS
PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) determines whether the key generated in IKEv1 Phase-2 is 
relevant with that in IKEv1 Phase-1. You can specify PFS as none, dh1, dh2, or dh5. None 
indicates that no PFS is configured, and the key generated in IKEv1 Phase-2 is relevant with 
that in IKEv1 Phase-1, whereas dh1, dh2, or dh5 means different key exchange groups, 
which make the key generated in IKEv1 Phase-2 irrelevant with that in IKEv1 Phase-1.
L2TP
L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) provides a way for a dial-up user to make a virtual PPP 
(Point-to-Point Protocol) connection to a VPN server. Because of the lack of confidentiality 
inherent in the L2TP protocol, it is often implemented along with IPsec. The basic concepts 
of L2TP are as follows:
 ■IPsec Encryption
IPsec encryption determines whether the traffic of the tunnel is encrypted with IPsec. You 
can select encrypted or unencrypted as the IPsec encryption. If encrypted is selected, Configuring VPN VPN
User Guide    127a pre-shared key needs to be entered, and then the L2TP traffic will be encrypted with a 
default IPsec configuration. If unencrypted is selected, the VPN tunnel traffic will not be 
encrypted.
 ■Authentication
L2TP uses an account name and password for authentication on the VPN server. Only legal 
clients can set up a tunnel with the server, thus enhancing network security.
PPTP
PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) is a network protocol that enables the secure 
transfer of data from a remote client to a private enterprise server by creating a VPN 
across TCP/IP-based data networks. PPTP supports on-demand, multi-protocol, virtual 
private networking over public networks, such as the internet. The basic concepts of PPTP 
are as follows:
 ■MPPE Encryption
MPPE (Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption) scheme is a means of representing PPP 
packets in an encrypted form defined in RFC 3078. You can select encrypted or 
unencrypted as MPPE encryption. If encrypted is selected, the VPN tunnel traffic will 
be encrypted with RSA RC4 algorithm to ensure data confidentiality. If unencrypted is 
selected, the VPN tunnel traffic will not be encrypted.
 ■Authenticaiton
PPTP uses an account name and password for authentication on the VPN server. Only legal 
clients can set up a tunnel with the server, thus enhancing network security.User Guide    128Configuring VPN IPSec VPN Configuration

User Guide    1571 Overview
Portal authentication, also known as Web authentication, is usually deployed in a guest-
access network (like a hotel or a coffee shop) to control the client’s internet access. In 
portal authentication, all the client’s HTTP requests will be redirected to an authentication 
page first. The client needs to enter the account information on the page to authenticate, 
then can visit the internet after the authentication succeeded.
1.1 Typical Topology
The typical topology of portal authentication is shown as below:
Figure 1-1 T opology of Portal Authentication
ClientAcc ess De viceWeb Serv er
Authent ication Serv er
 ■Client
The end device that needs to be authenticated before permitted to access the internet.
 ■Access Device
The device that supports portal authentication. In this user guide, it means the router. The 
Access Device helps to: redirect all HTTP requests to the Web Server before authenticated; 
interact with the Authentication Server to authenticate the client during the authentication 
process; permit users to access the internet after the authentication succeeded.
 ■Web Server
The web server responds to client’s HTTP requests, and returns an authentication login 
page.
 ■Authentication Server
The authentication server records the information of the user’s account, and interacts with 
the access device to authenticate clients.User Guide    158Configuring Authentication Overview
1.2 Portal Authentication Process

1) The client is connected to the router but not authenticated, and starts to visit the 
internet through HTTP;
2) The router redirects the client’s HTTP request to the web server;
3) The client visits the web server;
4) The Web server returns the authentication login page to the client;
5) The client enters the username and password on the authentication login page;
6) The router forwards the username and password to the authentication server;
7) The authentication server returns the authentication result to the router;
8) The router replies to the client with the authentication result;
9) The client visits the internet after the authentication succeeded.
1.3 Supported Features
To configure portal authentication, you need to configure both the web server and the 
authentication server. The web server provides the authentication page for login; the 
authentication server records the account information and authenticates the clients. Configuring Authentication Overview
User Guide    1591.3.1 Supported Web Server
The router has a built-in web server and also supports external web server. You can 
configure the authentication page either using the built-in server or the external server.
Custom Page
You can use the built-in web server and customize the authentication page on your router.
External Links
You can specify the external web server and configure the authentication page on the 
external web server.
1.3.2 Supported Authentication Server
The router provides three types of portal authentication:
Radius Authentication
In Radius authentication, you can specify an external Radius server as the authentication 
server. The user’s account information are recorded in the Radius server.
Local Authentication
If you don’t have an additional Radius server, you can choose local authentication. In local 
authentication, the router uses the built-in authentication server to authenticate. The built-
in authentication server can record at most 500 local user accounts, and each account is 
can be used for at most 1024 clients to authenticate.
Onekey Online
In Onekey Online Authentication, users can access the network without entering any 
account information. 
1.3.3 Guest Resources
Guest Resources is used to provide free resources for users before they pass the portal 
authentication.User Guide    160Configuring Authentication Local Authentication Configuration

1.1 Overview
The Services module incorporates two functions, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) and UPnP (Universal 
Plug and Play) to provide convenient network services.
1.2 Support Features
Dynamic DNS
Nowadays, network protocols such as PPPoE and DHCP are widely employed by ISPs to 
assign public IP addresses to users. The use of these protocols can cause the user’s public 
IP address to change dynamically. DDNS is an internet service that ensures a fixed domain 
name can be used to access a network with a varying public IP address. This means the 
user’s network can be more easily accessed by internet hosts.
UPnP
With the development of networking and advanced computing techniques, greater 
numbers of devices feature in networks. UPnP is designed to solve the problem of 
communication between these network devices. UPnP function allows devices dynamically 
discover and communicate with each other without additional configurations. For example, 
it allows the download of P2P software without opening ports.User Guide    182Managing Services Dynamic DNS Configurations

User Guide    1894 Configuration Example for Dynamic DNS
4.1 Network Requirement
Host A gets internet services from an ISP (Internet Service Provider) via a PPPoE dial-up 
connection. The user wants to visit the router’s web management interface using another 
host on the internet.
Figure 4-1 Network T opology
Internet
Internet Host Host A Router
4.2 Configuration Scheme
For security management, the internet hosts attempting to manage the router must be 
permitted by the router. Remote Management is used to manage the IP addresses of these 
hosts.
Because the user uses PPPoE to access the network, the public IP address of the router 
may be changed each time the dial-up connection is established. When the public IP 
address of the router changes, DDNS service ensures the DNS server rebinds the current 
domain name to the new IP address. This means the user can always reach the router using 
the same domain name, even if the public IP address has been changed.
4.3 Configuration Procedure
4.3.1 Specifying the IP Address of the Host
Before configuring DDNS, it is required to specify the IP address of the internet host 
for remote management. For details, go to System Tools > Admin Setup > Remote 
Management page.
4.3.2 Configuring the DDNS function
There are four DDNS servers supported by the router, we take Peanuthull DNS as an 
example here.

To make your controller adopt your router, make sure the router can be discovered by the 
controller. Controller Settings enable your router to be discovered in either of the following 
scenarios.
 ■If you are using Omada Cloud-Based Controller, Enable Cloud-Based Controller 
Management.
 ■If your router and controller are located in the same network, LAN and VLAN, the 
controller can discover and adopt the router without any controller settings. Otherwise, 
you need to inform the router of the controller’s URL/IP address, and one possible way 
is to Configure Controller Inform URL.
For details about the whole procedure, refer to the User Guide of Omada SDN Controller.

When choosing an ideal location to optimize the performance of repeater mode, please keep the points below in mind.Optimization Guide 
Generally, the ideal location for your TL-WR710N is half-way between your wireless router and your Wi-Fi enabled devices. If that is not possible, placing the TL-WR710N closer to your wireless router will ensure stable performance.The Best Way is Half-Way
Try to choose a location that will minimize the number of obstacles between the TL-WR710N and your wireless router. Open corridors or other spacious locations will typically provide better conditions for performance than a crowded room.Less Obstacles = Better Performance
Try to choose a location that minimizes interference from devices operating on the same wireless frequency, such as cordless phones bluetooth devices, and microwave ovens.Less Interference = More Stability

When choosing an ideal location to optimize the performance of repeater mode, please keep the points below in mind.Optimization Guide 
Generally, the ideal location for your TL-WR710N is half-way between your wireless router and your Wi-Fi enabled devices. If that is not possible, placing the TL-WR710N closer to your wireless router will ensure stable performance.The Best Way is Half-Way
Try to choose a location that will minimize the number of obstacles between the TL-WR710N and your wireless router. Open corridors or other spacious locations will typically provide better conditions for performance than a crowded room.Less Obstacles = Better Performance
Try to choose a location that minimizes interference from devices operating on the same wireless frequency, such as cordless phones bluetooth devices, and microwave ovens.Less Interference = More Stability

Q1. What should I do if I can’t access the web 
management page?
   Reboot your router and try again.
   If the computer is set to a static IP , change its settings to 
obtain an IP address automatically.
   Verify that http://tplinkwifi.net is correctly entered in the web

is active and functional.
3. Check the network condition:
•	Make sure your network has no firewall and no other limit.
•	Ensure the router can distribute IP address to your device or disable 
the static IP setting (DHCP is enabled by default on all EZVIZ devices).

1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and 
electronic equipment that has become waste is referred to as 
waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of 
it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before 
handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste 
equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical 
and electronic equipment and those grocery stores with a total 
sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities 
at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The 
possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end 
user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment 
to be disposed of.5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Network Security
This chapter guides you on how to protect your home network from cyber attacks 
and unauthorized users by implementing these three network security functions. You 
can protect your home network against DoS (Denial of Service) attacks from flooding 
your network with server requests using DoS Protection, block or allow specific client 
devices to access your network using Access Control, or you can prevent ARP spoofing 
and ARP attacks using IP & MAC Binding function.
This chapter contains the following sections:
• Protect the Network from Cyber Attacks
• Access Control
• IP & MAC Binding55Chapter 9  Network Security
9. 1. Protect the Network from Cyber Attacks
The SPI (Stateful Packet Inspection) Firewall and DoS (Denial of Service) Protection  
protect the router from cyber attacks. 
The SPI Firewall can prevent cyber attacks and validate the traffic that is passing 
through the router based on the protocol. This function is enabled by default, and it’s 
recommended to keep the default setting.
DoS Protection can protect your home network against DoS attacks from flooding your 
network with server requests. Follow the steps below to configure DoS Protection.
1. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and password you set for 
the router.
2. Go to Advanced > Security > Settings.
3. Enable DoS Protection .
4. Set the level ( Off, Low , Middle  or High ) of protection for ICMP-FLOOD Attack 
Filtering , UDP-FlOOD Attack Filtering  and TCP-SYN-FLOOD Attack Filtering .
• ICMP-FLOOD Attack Filtering  - Enable to prevent the Internet Control Message 
Protocol (ICMP) flood attack.
• UDP-FlOOD Attack Filtering - Enable to prevent the User Datagram Protocol 
(UDP) flood attack.
• TCP-SYN-FLOOD Attack Filtering  - Enable to prevent the Transmission Control 
Protocol-Synchronize (TCP-SYN) flood attack.56Chapter 9  Network Security
Tips: 
The level of protection is based on the traffic packets number. The protection will be triggered immediately 
when the number of packets exceeds the preset threshold value (the value can be set on Advanced  > System  
Tools  > System  Parameters  > DoS Protection Level Settings ), and the vicious host will be displayed in the Blocked 
DoS Host List .

from WAN port.
6. Select Forbid Ping Packet From LAN Port  if you want to ignore the ping packets 
from LAN port.
7. Click Save  to make the settings effective.
9. 2. Access Control
Access Control is used to block or allow specific client devices to access your network 
(via wired or wireless) based on a list of blocked devices (Blacklist) or a list of allowed 
devices (Whitelist).
Block or allow specific client devices to access my network (via 
wired or wireless).

Now you can block or allow specific client devices to access your 
network (via wired or wireless) using the Blacklist  or Whitelist .
9. 3. IP & MAC Binding
IP & MAC Binding, namely, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Binding, is used to bind 
network device’s IP address to its MAC address. This will prevent ARP Spoofing and 
other ARP attacks by denying network access to an device with matching IP address in 
the Binding list, but unrecognized MAC address.
Prevent ARP spoofing and ARP attacks.
1. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and 
password you set for the router.

NAT Forwarding
Router’s NAT (Network Address Translation) feature makes the devices in the LAN use 
the same public IP address to communicate in the Internet, which protect the local 
network by hiding IP addresses of the devices. However, it also brings about the 
problem that external host cannot initiatively communicate with the specified device 
in the local network.
With forwarding feature the router can penetrate the isolation of NAT and allows the 
external hosts in the Internet to initiatively communicate with the devices in the local 
network, thus to realize some special functions.
TP-LINK router includes four forwarding rules. If two or more rules are set, the priority 
of implementation from high to low is Virtual Servers, Port Triggering, UPNP and DMZ.
This chapter contains the following sections:
• Share Local Resources in the Internet by Virtual Server
• Open Ports Dynamically by Port Triggering
• Make Applications Free from Port Restriction by DMZ
• Make Xbox Online Games Run Smoothly by UPnP61Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
10. 1. Share Local Resources in the Internet by Virtual 
Server
When you build up a server in the local network and want to share it on the Internet, 
Virtual Server can realize the service and provide it to the Internet users. At the same 
time virtual server can keep the local network safe as other services are still invisible 
from the Internet.
Virtual server can be used for setting up public services in your local network, such as 
HTTP , FTP , DNS, POP3/SMTP and Telnet. Different service uses different service port. 
Port 80 is used in HTTP service, port 21 in FTP service, port 25 in SMTP service and port 
110 in POP3 service. Please verify the service port number before the configuration .
Share my personal website I’ve built in local network with my 
friends through the Internet.
For example,  the personal website has been built in my home 
PC (192.168.0.100). I hope that my friends in the Internet can 
visit my website in some way. The PC is connected to the router 
with the WAN IP address 218.18.232.154.
Router 
WAN: 218.18.232.154 LAN
HomePersonal Website 
1. Assign a static IP address to your PC, for example 
192.168.0.100.
2. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and 
password you set for the router.
3. Go to Advanced  > NAT Forwarding  > Virtual Servers , click Add .
4. Click View Existing Services , and select HTTP . The external 
port, internal port and protocol will be automatically filled 
with contents. Enter the PC’s IP address 192.168.0.100 in the 
Internal  IP field.
5. Click OK to save the settings.I want to:
How can I 
do that?62Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
Tips:
1. It is recommended to keep the default settings of  Internal Port and Protocol  if you 
are not clear about which port and protocol to use.
2. If the service you want to use is not in the Service  Type , you can enter the 
corresponding parameters manually. You should verify the port number that the 
service need.
3. You can add multiple virtual server rules if you want to provide several services in 
a router. Please note that the  External  Port  should not be overlapped.
Users in the Internet can enter http:// WAN IP  (in this example: 
http:// 218.18.232.154) to visit your personal website.
Tips:
1. WAN IP should be a public IP address. For the WAN IP is assigned dynamically by 
ISP , it is recommended to apply and register a domain name for the WAN refer to 
11. 4. Set Up a Dynamic DNS Service Account . Then you can use http:// domain name  
to visit the website.
2. If you have changed the default External Port , you should use  http:// WAN IP: 
External Port or http:// domain name: External Port to visit the website.
10. 2. Open Ports Dynamically by Port Triggering
Port triggering can specify a triggering port and its corresponding external ports. 
When a host in the local network initiates a connection to the triggering port, all the 
external ports will be opened for subsequent connections. The router can record the IP 
address of the host. When the data from the Internet return to the external ports, the 
router can forward them to the corresponding host. Port triggering is mainly applied 
to online games, VoIPs and video players. Common applications include MSN Gaming 
Zone, Dialpad and Quick Time 4 players, etc. 
Follow the steps below to configure the port triggering rules:Done!63Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
1. Visit  http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and password you set for the 
router.
2. Go to Advanced  > NAT Forwarding  > Port Triggering  and click Add .
3. Click View Existing Applications , and select the desired application. The external port, 
internal port and protocol will be automatically filled with contents. The following 
picture takes application MSN Gaming Zone  as an example.
4. Click OK to save the settings.
Tips:
1. You can add multiple port triggering rules according to your network need.
2. The triggering ports can not be overlapped.
3. If the application you need is not listed in the Existing Applications list, please enter the parameters manually. 
You should verify the external ports the application uses first and enter them into External Port field according 
to the format the page displays.
10. 3. Make Applications Free from Port Restriction by 
DMZ
When a PC is set to be a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) host in the local network, it is totally 
exposed to the Internet, which can realize the unlimited bidirectional communication 
between internal hosts and external hosts. The DMZ host becomes a virtual server with 
all ports opened. When you are not clear about which ports to open in some special 
applications, such as IP camera and database software, you can set the PC to be a DMZ 
host.
Note:
DMZ is more applicable in the situation that users are not clear about which ports to open. When it is enabled, the 
DMZ host is totally exposed to the Internet, which may bring some potential safety hazard. If DMZ is not in use, 
please disable it in time.64Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
Make the home PC join the Internet online game without port 
restriction.
For example,  due to some port restriction, when playing the 
online games, you can login normally but cannot join a team 
with other players. To solve this problem, set your PC as a DMZ 
with all ports opened.

10. 4. Make Xbox Online Games Run Smoothly by UPnP
UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) protocol allows the applications or host devices 
to automatically find the front-end NAT device and send request to it to open the 
corresponding ports. With UPnP enabled, the applications or host devices in the 
both sides of NAT device can freely communicate with each other realizing the 
seamless connection of the network. You may need to enable the UPnP if you want 
to use applications for multiplayer gaming, peer-to-peer connections, real-time 
communication (such as VoIP or telephone conference) or remote assistance, etc.
Tips:
1. UPnP is enabled by default in this router.
2. Only the application supporting UPnP protocol can use this feature.
3. UPnP feature needs the support of operating system (e.g. Windows Vista/ Windows 7/ Windows 8, etc. Some of 
operating system need to install the UPnP components).I want to:
How can I 
do that?
Done!65Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
For example, when you connect your Xbox to the router which has connected to 
the Internet to play online games, UPnP will send request to the router to open the 
corresponding ports allowing the following data penetrating the NAT to transmit. 
Therefore, you can play Xbox online games without a hitch.

11. 4. Set Up a Dynamic DNS Service Account
Most ISPs (Internet service provieders) assign a dynamic IP address to the router and 
you can use this IP address to access your router remotely. However, the IP address can 
change any time and you don’t know when it changes. In this case, you might need 
the DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name Server) feature on the router to allow you and your 
friends to access your router and local servers (FTP , HTTP , etc.) using domain name, in 
no need of checking and remembering the IP address. 
Note:  
DDNS does not work if the ISP assigns a private WAN IP address (such as 192.168.1.x) to the router. 71Chapter 11  Customize Your Network Settings
To set up DDNS, please follow the instructions below:
1. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and password you set for the 
router.

11. 5. Create Static Routes
Static routing is a form of routing that is configured manually by a network administrator 
or a user by adding entries into a routing table. The manually-configured routing 
information guides the router in forwarding data packets to the specific destination.
Visit multiple networks and multiple servers at the same time.
For example,  in a small office, my PC can surf the Internet, but I 
also want to visit my company’s network. Now I have a switch and 
another router. I connect the devices as shown in the following 
figure so that the physical connection between my PC and my 
company’s server is achieved. To surf the Internet and visit my 
company’s network at the same time, I need to configure the 
static routing.I want to:72Chapter 11  Customize Your Network Settings

the IP address of the company network is the destination IP How can 
I do that?73Chapter 11  Customize Your Network Settings
address, so here enters 172.30.30.1.  
Subnet Mask:  Determines the destination network with the 
destination IP address. If the destination is a single IP address, 
enter 255.255.255.255; otherwise, enter the subnet mask of 
the corresponding network IP . In the example, the destination 
network is a single IP , so here enters 255.255.255.255.
Default Gateway:  The IP address of the gateway device to which 
the data packets will be sent. This IP address must be on the 
same subnet with the router’s IP which sends out the data. In 
the example, the data packets will be sent to the LAN port of 
Router 2 and then to the Server, so the default gateway should 
be 192.168.0.2.
Interface:  Determined by the port (WAN/LAN) that sends out 
the data packets. In the example, the data is sent to the gateway 
through the LAN port, so LAN should be selected.

Network Security
This chapter guides you on how to protect your home network from cyber attacks and 
unauthorized users by implementing three network security features. You can prevent 
DoS (Denial of Service) attacks from flooding your network with server requests using 
DoS Protection, block or allow specific devices from accessing your network using 
Access Control, and prevent ARP spoofing and ARP attacks using IP & MAC Binding.       
It contains the following sections:
• Protect the Network from Cyber Attacks
• Access Control
• IP & MAC Binding50Chapter 9  Network Security
9. 1. Protect the Network from Cyber Attacks
The SPI (Stateful Packet Inspection) Firewall and DoS (Denial of Service) Protection  
protect the router from cyber attacks. 
The SPI Firewall can prevent cyber attacks and validate the traffic that is passing 
through the router based on the protocol. This function is enabled by default, and it’s 
recommended to keep the default settings.
DoS Protection can protect your home network against DoS attacks of flooding your 
network with server requests. Follow the steps below to configure DoS Protection.
1. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and password you set for 
the router.
2. Go to Advanced  > Security  > Settings .
3. Enable DoS Protection .
4. Set the level ( Off, Low , Middle  or High ) of protection for ICMP-FLOOD Attack 
Filtering , UDP-FlOOD Attack Filtering  and TCP-SYN-FLOOD Attack Filtering .
• ICMP-FLOOD Attack Filtering  - Enable to prevent the ICMP (Internet Control 
Message Protocol) flood attack.
• UDP-FlOOD Attack Filtering - Enable to prevent the UDP (User Datagram 
Protocol) flood attack.
• TCP-SYN-FLOOD Attack Filtering  - Enable to prevent the TCP-SYN (Transmission 
Control Protocol-Synchronize) flood attack.
Tips: 
The level of protection is based on the number of traffic packets. The protection will be triggered immediately 
when the number of packets exceeds the preset threshold value (the value can be set on Advanced  > System 
Tools  > System Parameters  > DoS Protection Level Settings ), and the vicious host will be displayed in the 
Blocked DoS Host List .51Chapter 9  Network Security
5. If you want to ignore the ping packets from the WAN port, select Ignore Ping Packet 
From WAN Port ; if you want to ignore the ping packets form the LAN port, select 
Ignore Ping Packet From LAN Port .
6. Click Save .
9. 2. Access Control
Access Control is used to block or allow specific client devices to access your network 
(via wired or wireless) based on a list of blocked devices (Blacklist) or a list of allowed 
devices (Whitelist).
Block or allow specific client devices to access my network (via 
wired or wireless).

Device Name  and MAC Address  (You can copy and paste 
the information from the Online Devices  list if the device 
is connected to your network).
3 ) Click OK.
Now you can block or allow specific client devices to access your 
network (via wired or wireless) using the Blacklist  or Whitelist .Done!53Chapter 9  Network Security
9. 3. IP & MAC Binding
IP & MAC Binding, namely, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Binding, is used to bind 
network device’s IP address to its MAC address. This will prevent ARP Spoofing and 
other ARP attacks by denying network access to an device with matching IP address in 
the Binding list, but unrecognized MAC address.
Prevent ARP spoofing and ARP attacks.
1. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and 
password you set for the router.
2. Go to Advanced  > Security  > IP & MAC Binding . 
3. Enable ARP Binding .

bind. Enter a Description  for this binding entry.
3 ) Tick the Enable This Entry  check box and click OK.
Now you don’t need to worry about ARP spoofing and ARP 
attacks!I want to:
How can I 
do that?
Done!Chapter 10
NAT Forwarding
The router’s NAT (Network Address Translation) feature means devices on a local 
network use the same public IP address to communicate with devices on the Internet, 
which protects local hosts by hiding their IP addresses. However, it also brings about 
a problem in that an external host cannot communicate with devices on the local 
network. With the forwarding feature, the router can allow external hosts on the 
Internet to reach local network devices. 
The TP-LINK router supports four forwarding rules. If two or more rules are set, the 
priority of implementation from high to low is Virtual Servers, Port Triggering, UPNP 
and DMZ.
It contains the following sections:
• Share Local Resources on the Internet by Virtual Servers
• Open Ports Dynamically by Port Triggering
• Make Applications Free from Port Restriction by DMZ
• Make Xbox Online Games Run Smoothly by UPnP55Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
10. 1. Share Local Resources on the Internet by Virtual 
Servers
When you build up a server on a local network and want to release it on the Internet, 
you can turn to Virtual Servers for help. In addition, Virtual Servers can ensure the 
security of your local network as other services are still invisible from the Internet.
Virtual Servers can be used for setting up public services on your local network, such 
as HTTP , FTP , DNS, POP3/SMTP and Telnet. Different services use different service ports. 
Port 80 is used in HTTP service, port 21 in FTP service, port 25 in SMTP service and port 
110 in POP3 service. Please verify the service port number before the configuration .
Share my personal website I’ve built in local network with my 
friends through the Internet.
For example,  the personal website has been built on my home 
PC (192.168.0.100). I hope that my friends on the Internet can 
visit my website in some way. The PC is connected to the router 
with the WAN IP address 218.18.232.154.
Personal Website
HomeRouter
WAN: 218.18.232.154 LAN
1. Assign a static IP address to your PC, for example 
192.168.0.100.
2. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and 
password you set for the router.
3. Go to Advanced  > NAT Forwarding  > Virtual Servers .
4. Click Add . Click View Existing Services  and select HTTP . The 
External Port , Internal Port and Protocol  will be automatically 
filled in. Enter the PC’s IP address 192.168.0.100 in the 
Internal  IP field.
5. Click OK.I want to:
How can I 
do that?INTERNET56Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
Tips:
1. It is recommended to keep the default settings of  Internal Port and Protocol  if you 
are not clear about which port and protocol to use.
2. If the service you want to use is not in the Service  Type , you can enter the 
corresponding parameters manually. You should verify the port number that the 
service needs.
3. You can add multiple virtual server rules if you want to provide several services in 
a router. Please note that the  External  Port  should not be overlapped.
Users on the Internet can enter http:// WAN IP  (in this example: 
http:// 218.18.232.154) to visit your personal website.
Tips:
1. The WAN IP should be a public IP address. Because  the WAN IP is assigned dynamically 
by the ISP , it is recommended to apply and register a domain name for the WAN 
referring to Set Up a Dynamic DNS Service Account . Then users on the Internet can use  
http:// domain name  to visit the website.
2. If you have changed the default External Port , you should use   
http:// WAN IP: External Port or http:// domain name: External Port to visit the 
website.
10. 2. Open Ports Dynamically by Port Triggering
Port Triggering can specify a triggering port and its corresponding external ports. 
When a host on the local network initiates a connection to the triggering port, all the 
external ports will be opened for subsequent connections. The router can record the IP 
address of the host. When the data from the Internet return to the external ports, the 
router can forward them to the corresponding host. Port Triggering is mainly applied to 
online games, VoIPs, video players and common applications including MSN Gaming 
Zone, Dialpad and Quick Time 4 players, etc. 
Follow the steps below to configure the Port Triggering rules:Done!57Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
1. Visit  http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and password you set for the 
router.
2. Go to Advanced > NAT Forwarding > Port Triggering  and click Add .
3. Click View Existing Applications , and select the desired application. The External Port, 
Internal Port  and Protocol  will be automatically filled in. The following picture takes 
application MSN Gaming Zone  as an example.
4. Click OK.
Tips:
1. You can add multiple port triggering rules according to your network need.
2. The triggering ports can not be overlapped.
3. If the application you need is not listed in the Existing Applications list, please enter the parameters manually. 
You should verify the external ports the application uses first and enter them into External Port  field according 
to the format the page displays.
10. 3. Make Applications Free from Port Restriction by 
DMZ
When a PC is set to be a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) host on the local network, it is totally 
exposed to the Internet, which can realize the unlimited bidirectional communication 
between internal hosts and external hosts. The DMZ host becomes a virtual server with 
all ports opened. When you are not clear about which ports to open in some special 
applications, such as IP camera and database software, you can set the PC to be a DMZ 
host.58Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
Note:
When DMZ is enabled, the DMZ host is totally exposed to the Internet, which may bring some potential safety 
hazards. If DMZ is not in use, please disable it in time.
Make the home PC join the Internet online game without port 
restriction.
For example,  due to some port restriction, when playing the 
online games, you can login normally but cannot join a team 
with other players. To solve this problem, set your PC as a DMZ 
host with all ports open.
1. Assign a static IP address to your PC, for example 
192.168.0.100.
2. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and 
password you set for the router.
3. Go to Advanced  > NAT Forwarding > DMZ  and select Enable 
DMZ .
4. Enter the IP address 192.168.0.100 in the DMZ Host IP 
Address filed.
5. Click Save .
The configuration is complete. You’ve set your PC to a DMZ host 
and now you can make a team to game with other players.
10. 4. Make Xbox Online Games Run Smoothly by UPnP
The UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) protocol allows applications or host devices 
to automatically find the front-end NAT device and send request to it to open the 
corresponding ports. With UPnP enabled, the applications or host devices on the local 
network and the Internet can freely communicate with each other, thus realizing the 
seamless connection of the network. You may need to enable the UPnP if you want 
to use applications for multiplayer gaming, peer-to-peer connections, real-time 
communication (such as VoIP or telephone conference) or remote assistance, etc.I want to:
How can I 
do that?
Done!59Chapter 10  NAT Forwarding
Tips:
1. UPnP is enabled by default in this router.
2. Only the application supporting UPnP protocol can use this feature.
3. UPnP feature needs the support of operating system (e.g. Windows Vista/ Windows 7/ Windows 8, etc. Some of 
operating system need to install the UPnP components).

VPN Server
The VPN (Virtual Private Networking) Server provides a secure way to access your home 
network over the Internet when you are away from home. The router offers two ways 
to setup VPN connection: OpenVPN and PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol) VPN. 
OpenVPN is somewhat complex but with greater security and stability. It is suitable for 
networks which are more limited geographically, such as campus networks or company 
intranet.
PPTP VPN is easy-to-use.It is faster than OpenVPN, compatible with most operating 
systems and supported on mobile devices. However, its security is poor and data 
packets are more vulnerable. In addition, a PPTP VPN connection may be blocked by 
some ISPs.  
It contains the following sections.  Please choose an appropriate VPN server connection 
type according to your needs.
• Use OpenVPN to Access Your Home Network
• Use PPTP VPN to Access Your Home Network61Chapter 11  VPN Server

12. 1. Change the LAN Settings
The router is preset with a default LAN IP 192.168.0.1, which you can use to log in to 
its web management page. The LAN IP address together with the Subnet Mask also 
defines the subnet that the connected devices are on. If the IP address conflicts with 
another device on your local network or your network requires a specific IP subnet, you 
can change it.
1. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and password you set for the 
router. 
2. Go to Advanced  > Network > LAN . 
3. Type in a new IP Address according to your needs. And leave the Subnet Mask  as the 
default settings. 
4. Click Save . 
Note:
If you have set the Virtual Server, DMZ or DHCP address reservation, and the new LAN IP address is not in the same 
subnet with the old one, then you should reconfigure these features.
12. 2. Configure to Support IPTV Service
Configure IPTV setup to enable Internet/IPTV/Phone service 
provided by my Internet Service Provider (ISP).
1. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and 
password you set for the router.
2. Go to Advanced  > Network  > IPTV .
3. If your ISP provides the networking service based on IGMP 
technology , e.g., British Telecom(BT) and Talk Talk in UK:
1 ) Tick the IGMP Proxy  checkbox and select the IGMP 
Version , either V2 or V3, as required by your ISP .I want to:

Most ISPs assign a dynamic IP address to the router and you can use this IP address 
to access your router remotely. However, the IP address can change any time and 
you don’t know when it changes. In this case, you might apply the DDNS (Dynamic 
Domain Name Server) feature on the router to allow you and your friends to access 
your router and local servers (FTP , HTTP , etc.) using domain name without checking and 
remembering the IP address. 
Note:  
DDNS does not work if the ISP assigns a private WAN IP address (such as 192.168.1.x) to the router. 
To set up DDNS, please follow the instructions below:
1. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and password you set for the 
router.

Tips:  
If you want to use a new DDNS account, please logout  first, and then log in with the new account.
12. 5. Create Static Routes
Static routing is a form of routing that is configured manually by a network administrator 
or a user by adding entries into a routing table. The manually-configured routing 
information guides the router in forwarding data packets to the specific destination.
Visit multiple networks and servers at the same time.
For example,  in a small office, my PC can surf the Internet 
through Router A, but I also want to visit my company’s network. 
Now I have a switch and Router B. I connect the devices as 
shown in the following figure so that the physical connection 
between my PC and my company’s server is established. To surf 
the Internet and visit my company’s network at the same time, I 
need to configure the static routing.
Company’s server
PCRouter B Router A
SwitchLAN: 192.168.0.1

password you set for Router A. 
3. Go to  Network  > Advanced Routing . 
4. Click Add  and finish the settings according to the following 
explanations:
Network Destination: The destination IP address that you want 
to assign to a static route. This IP address cannot be on the same 
subnet with the WAN IP or LAN IP of Router A. In the example, 
the IP address of the company network is the destination IP 
address, so here enter 172.30.30.1.  
Subnet Mask:  Determines the destination network with the 
destination IP address. If the destination is a single IP address, 
enter 255.255.255.255; otherwise, enter the subnet mask of 
the corresponding network IP . In the example, the destination 
network is a single IP , so here enter 255.255.255.255.
Default Gateway:  The IP address of the gateway device to which 
the data packets will be sent. This IP address must be on the 
same subnet with the router’s IP which sends out data. In the 
example, the data packets will be sent to the LAN port of Router 
B and then to the Server, so the default gateway should be 
192.168.0.2.How can 
I do that?75Chapter 12  Customize Your Network Settings
Interface:  Determined by the port (WAN/LAN) that sends out  
data packets. In the example, the data is sent to the gateway 
through the LAN port of Router A, so LAN  should be selected.
Description:  Enter a description for this static routing entry.
5. Click OK.

network?
For example , my house covers a large area. The wireless coverage of the router I’m using 
(the root router) is limited. I want to use an extended router to extend the wireless 
network of the root router.
Note:
• WDS bridging only requires configuration on the extended router.
• WDS bridging function can be enabled either in 2.4GHz frequency or 5GHz frequency for a dual-band router. We 
use the WDS bridging function in 2.4GHz frequency as example.
1. Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and password you set for the 
router. 
2. Configure the IP address of the router:
1 ) Go to Advanced  > Network  > LAN , configure the IP address of the extended 
router to be in the same subnet with the root router ; (For example, the IP 
address of the root router is 192.168.0.1, the IP address of the extended router 
can be 192.168.0.2~192.168.0.254. We take 192.168.0.2 as example.)
2 ) Click Save .
Note:  Log in to the web management page again if the IP address of the router is altered.
3. Survey the SSID to be bridged:
1 ) Go to Advanced  > System Tools  > System Parameters and focus on the 2.4GHz 
WDS  section, click Enable WDS Bridging .
2 ) Click Survey , locate the root router’s SSID and click Choose (Here we take  
TP-LINK_2512 as example).
3 ) If  the root router has wireless password, you should enter the wireless password 
of the root router.
4 ) Click Save .97
4. Disable DHCP:
1 ) Go to Network  > DHCP Server .
2 ) Deselect  Enable DHCP Server  and click Save .

Address  is selected), and click Save .
Tips:
• Some ISP will register the MAC address of your computer when you access the Internet for the first time 
through their Cable modem, if you add a router into your network to share your Internet connection, the 
ISP will not accept it as the MAC address is changed, so we need to clone your computer’s MAC address to 
the router.
• The MAC addresses of a computer in wired connection and wireless connection are different.
• Modify the LAN IP address of the router.
Note: 
Most TP-LINK routers use 192.168.0.1/192.168.1.1 as their default LAN IP address, which may conflict with the 
IP range of your existing ADSL modem/router. If so, the router is not able to communicate with your modem 
and you can’t access the Internet. To resolve this problem, we need to change the LAN IP address of the router 
to avoid such conflict, for example, 192.168.2.1. 1001 ) Visit http://tplinkwifi.net , and log in with the username and password you set 
for the router.

 Transmit Power -  Here you can specify the transmit power of router . You can sele ct High, 
Middle or Low which you would like. High is the default setting and is recommended.  
 Beacon Interval - Enter a value between 40-1000 milliseconds for Beacon Interval here. 
The beacons are the packets sent by the router  to synchronize a wireless net work. Beacon 
Interval value determines the time interval of the beacons. The default value is 100.  
 RTS Threshold -  Here you can specify the RTS (Request to Send) Threshold. If the packet 
is larger than the specified RTS Threshold size, the router  will sen d RTS frames to a 
particular receiving station and negotiate the sending of a data frame. The default value is 
2346.  
 Fragmentation Threshold - This value is the maximum size determining whether packets 
will be fragmented. Setting the Fragmentation Threshold too low may result in poor network performance because of excessive packets. 2346 is the default setting and is recommended.  
 DTIM Interval - This value determines the interval of the Delivery Traffic Indication Message 
(DTIM).  A DTIM field is a countdown field informing clients of the next window for listening to 
broadcast and multicast messages. When the router  has buffered broadcast or multicast 
- 57 - Archer C 5 AC1200 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router   
messages for associated clients, it sends the next DTIM with a DTIM Interval value. You can 
specify the val ue between 1- 255 Beacon Intervals. The default value is 1, which indicates 
the DTIM Interval is the same as Beacon Interval.  
 Enable WMM - WMM  function can guarantee the packets with high- priority messages being 
transmitted preferentially. It is strongly r ecommended.  
 Enable Short GI - This function is recommended for it will increase the data capacity by 
reducing the guard interval time .  
 Enable AP Isolation - This function can isolate wireless stations on your network from each 
other. Wireless devices wil l be able to communicate with the router  but not with each other. 
To use this function, check this box. AP Isolation is disabled by default.

Appendix D: Glossary  
 802.11ac - IEEE 802.11ac is a wireless computer networking standard of 802.11.This 
specification will enable multi -station WLAN throughput of at least 1 gigabit per second .This 
is accomplished by extending the air interface concepts embraced by 802.11n: wider RF 
bandwidth, more MIMO spatial streams, multi -user MIMO, and high- density modulation (up to 
256 QAM).  
 802.11n - 802.11n builds upon previous 802.11 standards by adding MIMO (multiple- input 
multiple -output). MIMO uses multiple transmitter and receiver antennas to allow for increased 
data throughput via spatial multiplexing and increased range by exploiting the spati al diversity, 
perhaps through coding schemes like Alamouti coding. The Enhanced Wireless Consortium 
(EWC) [3] was formed to help accelerate the IEEE 802.11n development process and 
promote a technology specification for interoperability of next -generation wireless local area 
networking (WLAN) products.  
 802.11b  - The 802.11b standard specifies a wireless networking at 11 Mbps using 
direct -sequence spread- spectrum (DSSS) technology and operating in the unlicensed radio 
spectrum at 2.4GHz, and WEP encryption f or security. 802.11b networks are also referred to 
as Wi -Fi networks.  
 802.11g  - specification for wireless networking at 54 Mbps using direct -sequence 
spread- spectrum (DSSS) technology, using OFDM modulation and operating in the 
unlicensed radio spectrum at 2.4GHz, and backward compatibility with IEEE 802.11b devices, and WEP encryption for security.  
 DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name System)  - The capability of assigning a fixed host and domain 
name to a dynamic Internet IP Address.  
 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - A protocol that automatically configure the 
TCP/IP parameters for the all the PC(s) that are connected to a DHCP server.  
 DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) - A Demilitarized Zone allows one local host to be exposed to the 
Internet for a special -purpose  service such as Internet gaming or videoconferencing.  
 DNS (Domain Name System)  - An Internet Service that translates the names of websites into 
IP addresses.  
 Domain Name - A descriptive name for an address or group of addresses on the Internet.  
 DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) - A technology that allows data to be sent or received over 
existing traditional phone lines . 
 ISP (Internet Service Provider) - A company that provides access to the Internet.  
- 132 - Archer C 5 AC1200 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router   
 MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit ) - The size in bytes of the largest packet that can be 
transmitted.  
 NAT (Network Address Translation) - NAT technology translates IP addresses of a local area 
network to a different IP address for the Internet.  
 PPPoE (Point to P oint Protocol over Ethernet) - PPPoE is a protocol for c onnecting remote 
hosts to the Internet over an always -on connection by simulating a dial -up connection.  
 SSID - A Service Set Identification is a thirty -two character (maximum) alphanumeric key 
identifying a wireless local area network. For the wireless dev ices in a network to 
communicate with each other, all devices must be configured with the same SSID. This is 
typically the configuration parameter for a wireless PC card. It corresponds to the ESSID in 
the wireless Access Point and to the wireless network name.  
 WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) - A data privacy mechanism based on a 64- bit or 128- bit or 
152-bit shared key algorithm, as described in the IEEE 802.11 standard.  
 Wi-Fi - A trade name for the 802.11b wireless networking standard, given by the Wireless 
Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA, see http://www.wi -fi.net), an industry standards group 
promoting interoperability among 802.11b devices.  
 WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) - A group of computers and associated devices 
communicate with each other wirelessly, which network serving users are limited in a local area.

Bandwidth Control
The Bandwidth Control feature is used to fully utilize your limited bandwidth and 
optimize the load respectively. With this feature enabled, you can assign a specific 
minimum or maximum bandwidth for each computer, thus minimizing the impact 
caused when the connection is under heavy load.20Chapter 5  Bandwidth Control
Use an independent bandwidth and enjoy a good Internet 
experience without being affected by other users who are 
sharing the same router.
For example , my roommate and I share 512Kbps Upstream 
Bandwidth and 8Mbps Downstream Bandwidth via this router, 
she likes to watch live show and play online games, which may 
take up much bandwidth. I don’t want to be affected, so we agree to equally distribute the bandwidth. Our IP addresses are 
192.168.1.101 and 192.168.1.110.
To use the bandwidth control feature, you’d better set static 
IP Address on each computer to be controlled or configure Address reservation on the modem router in order to manage 
easily. About how to configure address reservation, please refer 
to Reserve LAN IP Addresses.
1  Visit http://tplinkmodem.net, and log in with the password 
you set for the modem router.
2  Go to Advanced > Bandwidth Control page.
3  Enable Bandwidth Control , choose DSL on the line type. If 
you don’t know how to choose the line type, please contact 
your ISP which line type you have access.

address or IP address range according to your demands. 
When you configure the single IP address, the computer 
with this IP address will get independent given bandwidth. When you configure the IP address range, all 
computers in the range will share the given bandwidth.
2 ) Port Range: Keep the default settings. The default port 
range of TCP protocol or UDP protocol is from 1 to 65535.
3 ) Protocol: Keep the default setting. Or you can choose the 
TCP protocol or UDP protocol or both of them.
4 ) Priority: Keep the default setting. You can change the 
value if you want to first guarantee the bandwidth for 
one computer. The smaller value has the higher priority.
5 ) Upstream/Downstream: Enter the bandwidth according to your division.
6 ) Check to enable this entry and click OK to save the 
settings.
6  Follow the steps above to add a rule for the other computer. 
And then you will get the following table. 22Chapter 5  Bandwidth Control

Network Security
This chapter guides you on how to protect your home network from unauthorized 
users by implementing these three network security functions. You can block or allow 
specific client devices to access your wireless network using MAC Filtering, or using 
Access Control for wired and wireless networks, or you can prevent ARP spoofing and ARP attacks using IP & MAC Binding.
• MAC Filtering
• Access Control
• IP & MAC Binding24Chapter 6  Network Security
6  1  MAC Filtering
This function exploits the uniqueness of the MAC (Medium Access Control) address, 
a unique 12-digit hexadecimal address (for example, D8:5D:4C:B4:46:EA) of every 
network device, to determine if the device can or cannot access your wireless network.
Prevent unauthorized users from accessing my wireless network by utilizing the network device’s MAC address and IP address.
For example , I have a computer that is connected to my wireless 
network. Now, an unknown device (an intruder) is also using my 
wireless network, which affects my Internet speed. I would like to control my wireless network with the following capabilities:
• My computer is always allowed to access the wireless network.
• The unknown device is not allowed to access the wireless 
network.
• I don’t have to keep changing my wireless password as often.
1  Visit http://tplinkmodem.net, and log in with the password 
you set for the router.
2  Go to Advanced > Wireless > MAC Filtering and enable 
Wireless MAC Filtering .

NAT Forwarding
Modem router’s NAT (Network Address Translation) feature makes the devices in the 
LAN use the same public IP address to communicate in the Internet, which protects the 
local network by hiding IP addresses of the devices. However, it also brings about the 
problem that external host cannot initiatively communicate with the specified device in the local network.
With forwarding feature the modem router can penetrate the isolation of NAT and 
allows the external hosts in the Internet to initiatively communicate with the devices in the local network, thus to realize some special functions.
TP-LINK modem router includes four forwarding rules. If two or more rules are set, the 
priority of implementation from high to low is Virtual Servers, Port Triggering, UPNP 
and DMZ.
This chapter contains the following sections:
• Share Local Resources in the Internet by Virtual Server
• Open Ports Dynamically by Port Triggering
• Make Applications Free from Port Restriction by DMZ
• Make Xbox Online Games Run Smoothly by UPnP57Chapter 11  NAT Forwarding
11  1  Share Local Resources in the Internet by Virtual 
Server
When you build up a server in the local network and want to share it on the Internet, 
Virtual Server can realize the service and provide it to the Internet users. At the same 
time virtual server can keep the local network safe as other services are still invisible 
from the Internet.
Virtual server can be used for setting up public services in your local network, such as 
HTTP , FTP , DNS, POP3/SMTP and Telnet. Different service uses different service port. 
Port 80 is used in HTTP service, port 21 in FTP service, port 25 in SMTP service and port 110 in POP3 service. Please verify the service port number before the configuration.
share my personal website I’ve built in local network with my friends through the Internet.
For example , the personal website has been built in my home PC 
(192.168.1.100). I hope that my friends in the Internet can visit

 domain name to visit the website.
2. If you have changed the default External Port , you should use http://  WAN IP: 
External Port or http://  domain name: External Port to visit the website.
11  2  Open Ports Dynamically by Port Triggering
Port triggering can specify a triggering port and its corresponding external ports. When a host in the local network initiates a connection to the triggering port, all the external 
ports will be opened for subsequent connections. The modem router can record the IP 
address of the host. When the data from the Internet return to the external ports, the Done!59Chapter 11  NAT Forwarding
modem router can forward them to the corresponding host. Port triggering is mainly 
applied to online games, VoIPs and video players. Common applications include MSN 
Gaming Zone, Dialpad and Quick Time 4 players, etc. 
Follow the steps below to configure the port triggering rules:
1  Visit http://tplinkmodem.net, and log in with the password you set for the modem 
router.
2  Go to Advanced > NAT Forwarding > Port Triggering and click Add .

Tips:
1. You can add multiple port triggering rules according to your network need.
2. If the application you need is not listed in the Existing Applications list, please enter the parameters manually. 
You should verify the external ports the application uses first and enter them into External Port field according 
to the format the page displays.
11  3  Make Applications Free from Port Restriction by 
DMZ
When a PC is set to be a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) host in the local network, it is totally 
exposed to the Internet, which can realize the unlimited bidirectional communication 
between internal hosts and external hosts. The DMZ host becomes a virtual server with 60Chapter 11  NAT Forwarding
all ports opened. When you are not clear about which ports to open in some special 
applications, like IP camera and database software, you can set the PC to be a DMZ 
host.
Note:
DMZ is more applicable in the situation that users are not clear about which ports to open. When it is enabled, the DMZ host is totally exposed to the Internet, which may bring some potential safety hazard. If DMZ is not in use, 
please disable it in time.
make the home PC join the Internet online game without port restriction.
For example , due to some port restriction, when playing the 
online games, you can log in but cannot join a team with other 
players. To solve this problem, set your PC as a DMZ with all 
ports opened.
1  Assign a static IP address to your PC, for example

11  4  Make Xbox Online Games Run Smoothly by UPnP
UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) protocol allows the applications or host devices to automatically find the front-end NAT device and send request to it to open the 
corresponding ports. With UPnP enabled, the applications or host devices in the 
both sides of NAT device can freely communicate with each other realizing the seamless connection of the network. You may need to enable the UPnP if you want I want to:
How can I 
do that?
Done!61Chapter 11  NAT Forwarding
to use applications for multiplayer gaming, peer-to-peer connections, real-time 
communication (such as VoIP or telephone conference) or remote assistance, etc.
Tips:
1. UPnP is enabled by default in this modem router.
2. Only the application supporting UPnP protocol can use this feature.
3. UPnP feature needs the support of operating system (e.g. Windows Vista/ Windows 7/ Windows 8, etc. Some of operating system need to install the UPnP components).
For example , When you connect your Xbox to the modem router which has connected 
to the Internet to play online games, UPnP will send request to the modem router to 
open the corresponding ports allowing the following data penetrating the NAT to 
transmit. Therefore, you can play Xbox online games without a hitch.

Chapter 12
Specify Your Network 
Settings
This chapter introduces how to change the default settings or adjust the basic 
configuration of the modem router using the web-based management page.
This chapter contains the following sections:
• LAN Settings
• Wireless Settings
• Set Up a Dynamic DNS Service Account
• Interface Grouping
• Create Static Routes
• Set up a VPN Connection
• Set Up the IPv6 Tunnel63Chapter 12  Specify Your Network Settings
12  1  LAN Settings
12  1  1  Change the LAN IP Address
The modem router is preset with a default LAN IP 192.168.1.1, which you can use to log 
in to its web-based management page. The LAN IP address together with the Subnet 
Mask also defines the subnet that the connected devices are on. If the IP address 
conflicts with another device on your local network or your network requires a specific IP subnet, you can change it.
Follow the steps below to change your IP address.
1  Visit http://tplinkmodem.net, and log in with the password you set for the modem 
router. 
2  Go to Advanced > Network > LAN Settings page and select IPv4.
 
3  Type in a new IP Address appropriate to your needs.
4  Select the Subnet Mask from the drop-down list. The subnet mask together with 
the IP address identifies the local IP subnet.
5  Keep IGMP Snooping as enabled by default. IGMP snooping is the process of 
listening to IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) network traffic. The function prevents hosts on a local network from receiving traffic for a multicast 
group they have not explicitly joined. 
6  You can configure the modem router’s Second IP and Subnet Mask for LAN interface through which you can also access the web management page.
7  Leave the rest of the default settings as they are.
8  Click Save  to make the settings effective.
12  1  2  Use the Modem Router as a DHCP Server
You can configure the modem router to act as a DHCP server to assign IP addresses to 
its clients. To use the DHCP server function of the modem router, you must configure all 
computers on the LAN to obtain an IP Address automatically.64Chapter 12  Specify Your Network Settings
Follow the steps below to configure DHCP server.
1  Visit http://tplinkmodem.net, and log in with the password you set for the modem 
router. 
2  Go to Advanced > Network > LAN Settings page and select IPv4.
3  Select DHCP to enable the DHCP function and select DHCP Server .
4  Specify the IP Address Pool , the start address and end address must be on the same 
subnet with LAN IP . The modem router will assign addresses within this specified 
range to its clients. It is from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.199 by default. 
5  Enter a value for the Address Lease Time . The Address Lease Time is the amount of 
time in which a DHCP client can lease its current dynamic IP address assigned by the modem router. After the dynamic IP address expires, the user will be automatically 
assigned a new dynamic IP address. The default is 1440 minutes.
6  Keep the rest of the settings as default and click Save  to make your settings effective.
Note: 
1. The modem router can be configured to work as a DHCP Relay . A DHCP relay is a computer that forwards DHCP 
data between computers that request IP addresses and the DHCP server that assigns the addresses. Each of the 
device’s interfaces can be configured as a DHCP relay. If it is enabled, the DHCP requests from local PCs will be forwarded to the DHCP server that runs on WAN side. 
2. You can also appoint IP addresses within a specified range to devices of the same type by using Condition Pool feature. For example, you can assign IP addresses within the range (192.168.1.50 to192.168.1.80) to Camera 
devices, thus facilitating the network management. Enable DHCP feature and configure the parameters according 
to your actual situation on Advanced > Network > LAN Settings page. 
12  1  3  Reserve LAN IP Addresses
You can view and add a reserved address for a client. When you specify an IP address for a device on the LAN, that device will always receive the same IP address each time 
when it accesses the DHCP server. If there are some devices in the LAN that require 65Chapter 12  Specify Your Network Settings
permanent IP addresses, please configure Address Reservation on the router for the 
purpose.
Follow the steps below to reserve an IP address for your device.
1  Visit http://tplinkmodem.net, and log in with the password you set for the modem 
router. 
2  Go to  Advanced > Network > LAN Settings page and select IPv4.
3  Scroll down to locate the Address Reservation table and click Add  to add an address 
reservation entry for your device.

• Beacon Interval: Enter a value between 25 and 1000 in milliseconds to determine the 
duration between which beacon packets are broadcasted by the router to synchronize the wireless network. The default is 100 milliseconds.
• RTS Threshold: Enter a value between 1 and 2346 to determine the packet size of 
data transmission through the router. By default, the RTS (Request to Send) Threshold 
size is 2346. If the packet size is greater than the preset threshold, the router sends 
Request to Send frames to a particular receiving station and negotiates the sending of a data frame, or else the packet will be sent immediately.
• DTIM Interval: Enter a value between 1 and 255 to determine the interval of the Delivery Traffic Indication Message (DTIM). 1 indicates the DTIM Interval is the same as Beacon Interval .
• Group Key Update Period: Enter the number of seconds to control the time interval for the encryption key automatic renewal. The default is 0, indicating no key renewal.
• Enable WMM: This feature guarantees the packets with high-priority messages being 
transmitted preferentially. WMM is enabled compulsively under 802.11n or 802.11ac mode. It is strongly recommended to enable WMM.
• Enable Short GI: This feature is enabled by default and recommended to increase the 
data capacity by reducing the Guard Interval (GI) time.

area network (WLAN). Refer to Appendix B: Troubleshooting for detailed instructions.73Chapter 12  Specify Your Network Settings
12  3  Set Up a Dynamic DNS Service Account
Most ISPs (Internet service providers) assign a dynamic IP address to the router and 
you can use this IP address to access your router remotely. However, the IP address can 
change any time and you don’t know when it changes. In this case, you might need 
the DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name Server) feature on the router to allow you and your friends to access your router and local servers (FTP , HTTP , etc.) using domain name, in 
no need of checking and remembering the IP address. 
Note: DDNS does not work if the ISP assigns a private WAN IP address (such as 192.168.1.x) to the modem router. 
To set up DDNS, please follow the instructions below:
1  Visit http://tplinkmodem.net, and log in with the password you set for the modem 
router.
2  Go to Advanced > Network> Dynamic DNS.

Now your working devices connected to LAN1 and LAN3 are in 
an isolated group!
Note: VLAN function is enabled by default. You cannot disable it when IPTV is 
enabled.
12  5  Create Static Routes
A static route is a pre-determined path that network information must travel to reach a specific host or network. Data from one point to another will always follow the same 
path regardless of other considerations. Normal Internet usage does not require this 
setting to be configured.
Visit multiple networks and multiple servers at the same time.
For example , in a small office, my PC can surf the Internet, but I 
also want to visit my company’s server. Now I have a switch and 
another router. I connect the devices as shown in the following 
figure so that the physical connection between my PC and my 
company’s server is achieved. To surf the Internet and visit my company’s network at the same time, I need to configure the 
static routing.

I want to:
How can I 
do that?76Chapter 12  Specify Your Network Settings
4  Click Add  to add a new static routing entry. Finish the settings 
according to the following explanations:
• Destination IP: The destination IP address that you want to 
assign to a static route. This IP address cannot be on the same 
subnet with the WAN IP or LAN IP of the router. In the example, 
the IP address of the company network is the destination IP address, so here enters 172.30.30.1. 
• Subnet Mask: Determines the destination network with the destination IP address. If the destination is a single IP address, enter 255.255.255.255; otherwise, enter the subnet mask of 
the corresponding network IP . In the example, the destination 
network is a single IP , so here enters 255.255.255.255.
• Gateway: The IP address of the gateway device to which the 
data packets will be sent. This IP address must be on the same subnet with the router’s IP which sends out the data. In the 
example, the data packets will be sent to the LAN port of 77Chapter 12  Specify Your Network Settings
Router 2 and then to the Server, so the default gateway should 
be 192.168.1.2.
• Interface: Determined by the port (WAN/LAN) that sends out the data packets. In the example, the data is sent to the gateway through the LAN port, so LAN should be selected.
5  Check to enable this entry and click OK to save the settings.
Open a web browser on your PC. Enter the company server’s IP 
address to visit the company network.
12  6  Set up a VPN Connection
VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a private network established across the public network, 
generally via the Internet. However, the private network is a logical network without 
any physical network lines, so it is called Virtual Private Network.  
With the wide application of the Internet, more and more data are needed to be shared 
through the Internet. Connecting the local network to the Internet directly, though can 
allow the data exchange, will cause the private data to be exposed to all the users on 
the Internet.
The VPN (Virtual Private Network) technology is developed and used to establish 
the private network through the public network, which can provides a secure 
communication to a remote computer or remote network, and guarantee a secured 
data exchange. IPSec is one of the major implementations of VPNs.
Establish an IPSec VPN tunnel to connect two LANs via Internet so that the hosts in different remote LANs are able to communicate with each as if they are in the same LAN.
For example , I am the network administrator of a regional office, 
I need to let my office staff can visit the headquarter’s servers 
and resources, and vice versa. I know that the modem router 
in my office and the device in headquarter both support IPSec 
VPN feature, so I decide to set up a VPN connection with the headquarter office.
The following diagram is a typical VPN topology. Here Site A 
refers to regional office’s network (local network). And Site B 
refers to the headquarter’s network (remote network) which I want to connect.Done!

click Disable and then click Enable after Site A back on line in order to re-establish the IPSec tunnel.
12  7  Set Up the IPv6 Tunnel
The IPv6 Tunnel feature helps you obtain IPv6 resources based on an IPv4 WAN connection or vice versa.
IPv6 Tunnel is a transition mechanism that enables IPv6-only hosts to reach IPv4 
services or vice versa and allows isolated IPv6 hosts and networks to reach each other over IPv4-only infrastructure before IPv6 completely supplants IPv4. It is a temporary 
solution for networks that do not support native dual-stack, where both IPv6 and IPv4 
run independently.
The modem router provides three tunneling mechanisms: 6to4, 6rd and DS-Lite . The 
way to set up 6rd and DS-Lite tunnel are similar.
12  7  1  Use the Public IPv6 Tunnel Service-6to4
The 6to4 tunnel is a kind of public service. If there is any 6to4 server in your network, 
you can use this mechanism to access IPv6 service. If your ISP provides you with an 
IPv4-only connection but you want to visit IPv6 websites, you can try to set up a 6to4 
tunnel.Done!82Chapter 12  Specify Your Network Settings
Set up the IPv6 tunnel though my ISP doesn’t provide me with 
the tunnel service. 
1  Visit http://tplinkmodem.net, and log in with the password 
you set for the modem router.
2  Go to Advanced > Network > IPv6 Tunnel .
3  Tick the check box, select 6to4 as the tunneling mechanism 
and select a WAN connection from the drop-down list, then click Save .
Note:
If there is no available WAN connection to choose, make sure you have connected to 
the Internet and the connection type is not Bridge.
Now you can visit the IPv6 websites with the 6to4 tunnel.
Note:
Still not being able to access IPv6 resources means that not any 6to4 public server was found in your network. You can contact your ISP to sign up for IPv6 connection service.
12  7  2  Specify the 6rd Tunnel with Parameters Provided by Your ISP
Specify the 6rd tunnel with the parameters provided by my 6rd 
tunnel service provider.
1  Visit http://tplinkmodem.net, and log in with the password 
you set for the modem router.
2  Go to Advanced > Network > IPv6 Tunnel .
3  Tick the check box, select 6rd  as the tunneling mechanism 
and select a WAN connection from the drop-down list.
4  According to the parameters provided by your ISP , choose 
Auto  or Manual . More parameters are needed if you choose 
Manual .
5  Click Save .I want to:
How can I 
do that?
Done!

Note:
If there is no available WAN connection to choose, make sure you have connected to 
the Internet and the connection type is not Bridge.
Now you can visit the IPv6 websites with the 6rd tunnel.
Tips:
The way to set up DS-Lite tunnel is similar to that of 6rd tunnel. If you are provided with an IPv6-only WAN connection and have signed up for DS-Lite tunnel service, specify the DS-Lite tunnel by referring to the steps above.Done!Chapter 13

Choose a location with a clear, unblocked field of view and with a good wireless signal to the camera. Please keep the following 
tips in mind:
• Make sure the wall is strong enough to withstand three times the weight of the camera.
• Recommended installation height: 7-10 ft (2-3 m) above the ground.
• Recommended installation angle:  Tilt down 20 degrees.
• Make sure that side-to-side traffic crosses camera’s field of view. The camera’s motion sensor is much more sensitive to side-
to-side movement across its field of view than to movement directly toward or away from the camera.520°
Limited by PIR detection technology, the camera may fail to detect motion when environment temperature is close to 
human body temperature or someone approaches the PIR sensor vertically.
• It is recommended to set detection sensitivity on the EZVIZ app when selecting location. Thus you can verify if motion can be 
detected in the camera’s placement and adjust the sensitivity based on the size and distance of detected object.
Important Notes on Reducing False Alarms:
• Do not install the camera under strong light conditions, including sunshine, bright lamp lights, etc.
• Do not place the camera near any outlets, including the air conditioner vents, humidifier outlets, the heat transfer 
vents of projectors, etc
• Do not install the camera at places with strong wind .
• Do not install the camera in front of a mirror.
• Keep the camera at least 1 meter away from any wireless devices, including Wi-Fi routers and phones in order to avoid 
wireless interference.

Dear Valued EZVIZ Users,
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a forward-looking tech company, we are increasingly aware of 
the role technology plays in improving efficiency and quality of our life. At the same time, we are also aware of the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products can record real, complete and clear images, therefore they hold great values in representing facts. Nevertheless, improper distribution, use and/or processing of video records may infringe on the privacy, legitimate rights and interests of others.
Committed to innovating technology for the good, we at EZVIZ hereby earnestly advocate that every user shall 
use video products properly and responsibly, thus to collectively create a positive environment where all related practices and usage comply with applicable laws and regulations, respect individuals’ interests and rights, and promote social morality.
Here are EZVIZ’s initiatives that we’d appreciate your attention:1.Each individual possesses a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the use of video products should not be 
in conflict with such reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice which clarifies the monitoring range should be displayed in a reasonable and effective manner, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, the rights and interests of people involved shall be evaluated thoughtfully, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products without other’s knowledge.
2.Video products objectively records footage of real activities within specific time and space. Users shall 
reasonably identify the people and rights involved in this scope in advance, to avoid any infringement of portrait, privacy or other legal rights of others while protecting themselves through video products. Notably, if you choose to enable the audio recording function on your camera, it will capture sounds, including conversations, within the monitoring range. We highly recommend a comprehensive assessment on the potential sound sources in the monitoring range, so as to fully understand the necessity and the reasonableness before you turn on the audio recording function.
3.Video products in use will consistently generate audio or visual data from real scenes –possibly including 
biometric information such as facial images – based on the user’s selection of product features. Such data can be used or processed to use. Video products are only technological tools that do not and cannot humanly practice legal and moral standards to guide lawful and proper use of data. It is the methods and purposes of the people who control and use the generated data that make a difference. Therefore, data controllers shall not only strictly abide by applicable laws and regulations, but also fully respect non-obligatory rules including international conventions, moral standards, cultural norms, public order and local customs. Furthermore, we should always prioritize the protection of privacy and portrait rights, and other reasonable interests.
4.The video data continuously generated by video products carries the rights, values and other demands of 
various stakeholders. Thus, it is extremely crucial to ensure data security and shield the products from malicious intrusions. Every user and data controller shall, undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to maximize product and data security, avoiding data leakage, improper disclosure or misuse, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5.Video products have made great contributions to enhance the safety of our society, and we believe that they 
will continue to play a positive role in various aspects of our daily life. Any attempt to abuse these products to violate human rights or engage in unlawful activities contradicts the very essence of the value in tech innovation and product development. We encourage every user to establish your own methods and rules to evaluate and monitor the use of video products, so as to ensure that these products are always used properly, thoughtfully and with goodwill.13Appendix

2  INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that has become 
waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately 
from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, 
but in special collection and return systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as 
a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste 
equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from 
the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste 
equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households 
can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and 
Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic 
equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of 
distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment 
are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the 
same functions is delivered to an end user.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For 
example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. 
This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.
Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining 
the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as 
facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and 
respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, 
selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video 
products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall 
establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to 
ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.10Appendix

2. INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that 
has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that 
are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste 
equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or 
distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. 
Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the 
total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, 
ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology 
such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each 
end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out 11wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that 
the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Installation Location
Choose a location with a clear, unblocked field of view and with a good wireless signal to the base 
station. Please keep the following tips in mind:
•	Make sure the wall is strong enough to withstand three times the weight of the camera.
•	Camera cannot be installed in front of an air conditioner or facing direct sunlight.
•	Recommended installation height: 7-10 ft (2-3 m) above the ground.
25 ft (7.5 m)Motion 
Detection 
ZoneCamera Field of View
7-10ft
 (2-3 m)
•	Make sure that side-to-side traffic crosses camera’s field of view. The camera’s motion sensor 
is much more sensitive to side-to-side movement across its field of view than to movement 
directly toward or away from the camera.
Best Detection
Poor
•	It is recommended to set detection sensitivity on EZVIZ app when selecting location. Thus you 
can verify if motion can be detected in the camera’s placement and adjust the sensitivity  based 
on the size and distance of detected object .
Installation Steps
Step 1 Place drill template onto	a	clean	and	flat	surface.
Step 2 (For the cement wall only)  Drill screw holes according to the template, and insert anchors.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-
time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, 
use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring 
range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated 
when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a 
large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that 
is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, 
every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights 
or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, 
each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, 
the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording 
real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy 
of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video 
products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should 
not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining 
the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and 
under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in 
such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be 
generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result 
of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data 
controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered 
when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data 
leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access 
control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the 
world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. 
Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary 
to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.13Appendix

2  INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that has become 
waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately 
from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, 
but in special collection and return systems.

equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households 
can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and 
Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic 
equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of 
distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment 
are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the 
same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular 
to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. 
In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste 
equipment to be disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin 
regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, 
the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording 
real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy 
of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video 
products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should 
not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining 
the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and 
under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in 
such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be 
generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result 
of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data 
controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered 
when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data 
leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access 
control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the 
world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. 
Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary 
to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.13Appendix

2  INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that has become 
waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately 
from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, 
but in special collection and return systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as 
a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste 
equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from 
the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste 
equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households 
can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and 
Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic 
equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of 
distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment 
are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the 
same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular 
to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. 
In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste 
equipment to be disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin 
regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the 
installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a 
specific time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from 13real scenes will continue to be generated, including a large amount 
of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders 
should always be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement 
of social security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.14INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE  
HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic 
equipment that has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners 
of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a 
collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for 
reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste 
equipment from private households can return it free of charge to the 
collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of 15returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who 
are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive 
personal data. This applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a 
crossed-out wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative 11requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good 
morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and 
respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should 
always be considered when processing video data that is continuously 
generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data 
security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, 
including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable 
network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of 
social security around the world, and we believe that these products will also 
play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products 
in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism 
of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper 
and reasonable manner and with good faith.12INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic 
equipment that has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, 13please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the 
waste equipment to be disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a 
crossed-out wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic 
equipment indicates that the respective device is to be collected separately 
from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are 
increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency 
and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. 
However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights 
and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes 
place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create 
a better community.
Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the 
monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public 
areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video 
products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific 
time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first 
reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid 
infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such 
as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video 
products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use 
the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and 
regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international 
norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory 
requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video 
products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. 
Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and 
necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video 
products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social 
security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent 
of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall 
establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to 
ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.12INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that 
has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment 
must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste 
equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste 
equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that 
are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste 
equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private 
households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste 
management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment 
and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer 
electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis 
and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the 
total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, 
ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from 
the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar	device	that	essentially	fulfills	the	same	functions	is	delivered	to	an	end	user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This 
applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology 
such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out 
wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that 
the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are 
increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and 
quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video 
products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time 
and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes 
will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always 
be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social 
security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.12INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that 
has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment 
must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste 
equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video 
products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time 
and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes 
will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always 
be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social 
security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are 
increasingly	 aware	of	the	role	technology	 plays	in	improving	 business	 efficiency	 and	
quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For 
example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it 
may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests 
if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the 
philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.
Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video 
products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public 
areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video 
products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining 
the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.2.	The	purpose	of	video	products 	is	to	record	real	activities 	within	a	specific	 time	
and	space	and	under	specific	conditions.	 Therefore,	 every	user	shall	first	reasonably	
define	his/her	own	rights	in	such	specific	scope,	in	order	to	avoid	infringing	 on	a	
third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data 
based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage 
depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, 
good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and 
respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. 
Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and 
necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper 
disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social 
security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an 
active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall 
establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to 
ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good 
faith.

HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic 
equipment that has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not 
belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for 
reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and 
those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that 
offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in 
principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a 9reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of 
returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal 
data. This applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic

Dear Valued EZVIZ Users,
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a forward-looking tech company, we are increasingly 
aware of the role technology plays in improving efficiency and quality of our life. At the same time, we are also aware of the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products can record real, complete and clear images, therefore they hold great values in representing facts. Nevertheless, improper distribution, use and/or processing of video records may infringe on the privacy, legitimate rights and interests of others.
Committed to innovating technology for the good, we at EZVIZ hereby earnestly advocate that every user 
shall use video products properly and responsibly, thus to collectively create a positive environment where all related practices and usage comply with applicable laws and regulations, respect individuals’ interests and rights, and promote social morality.
Here are EZVIZ’s initiatives that we’d appreciate your attention:
1. Each individual possesses a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the use of video products should not 
be in conflict with such reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice which clarifies the monitoring range should be displayed in a reasonable and effective manner, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, the rights and interests of people involved shall be evaluated thoughtfully, 
including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, 
and not installing highly-invisible video products without other’s knowledge.
2. Video products objectively records footage of real activities within specific time and space. Users shall 
reasonably identify the people and rights involved in this scope in advance, to avoid any infringement of portrait, privacy or other legal rights of others while protecting themselves through video products. Notably, if you choose to enable the audio recording function on your camera, it will capture sounds, including conversations, within the monitoring range. We highly recommend a comprehensive assessment on the potential sound sources in the monitoring range, so as to fully understand the necessity and the reasonableness before you turn on the audio recording function.
3. Video products in use will consistently generate audio or visual data from real scenes –possibly 
including biometric information such as facial images – based on the user’s selection of product features. 
Such data can be used or processed to use. Video products are only technological tools that do not 
and cannot humanly practice legal and moral standards to guide lawful and proper use of data. It is the 
methods and purposes of the people who control and use the generated data that make a difference. 
Therefore, data controllers shall not only strictly abide by applicable laws and regulations, but also fully 
respect non-obligatory rules including international conventions, moral standards, cultural norms, public 
order and local customs. Furthermore, we should always prioritize the protection of privacy and portrait 
rights, and other reasonable interests.
4. The video data continuously generated by video products carries the rights, values and other demands 
of various stakeholders. Thus, it is extremely crucial to ensure data security and shield the products from malicious intrusions. Every user and data controller shall, undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to maximize product and data security, avoiding data leakage, improper disclosure or misuse, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to enhance the safety of our society, and we believe that 
they will continue to play a positive role in various aspects of our daily life. Any attempt to abuse these 
products to violate human rights or engage in unlawful activities contradicts the very essence of the value 
in tech innovation and product development. We encourage every user to establish your own methods and 
rules to evaluate and monitor the use of video products, so as to ensure that these products are always 
used properly, thoughtfully and with goodwill.12INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that has become 
waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, 
but in special collection and return systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment 
before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for 
reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and 
Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic 
equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of 
distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment 
are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the 
same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. 
In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste 
equipment to be disposed of.5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that the respective device is to be 
collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Initiatives on the Use of Video Products9Initiatives on the Use of Video Products
Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.

HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment 
that has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste 
equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from 
private households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This 
applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be 9disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out 
wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that 
the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste 
at the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are 
increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and 
quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For 
example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. 
This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it 
may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests 
if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the 
philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of 
video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and 
regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.
Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video 
products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a 
warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the 
monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public 
areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video 
products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining 
the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time 
and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably 
define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third 
party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes 
will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as 
facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data 
based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage 
depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data 
controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and 
other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, 
good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect 
individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always 
be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video 
products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. 
Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and 
necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper 
disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, 
selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video 
products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social 
security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an 
active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation 
of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent 
of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall 
establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to 
ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good 
faith.7INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that 
has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment 
must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste 
equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return 
systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment 
shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not 
enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment 
without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a 
collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with 
the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private 
households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste 
management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or 
distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. 
Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment 
and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer 
electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis 
and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies 
in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage 
and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the 
total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, 
ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from 
the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge 
exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new 
similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This 
applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology 
such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end 
user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out 
wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that 
the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at 
the end of its service life.

 14Initiatives on the Use of Video Products
Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in 
improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video 
products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-
time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, 
use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end 
user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, 
aiming to jointly create a better community.
Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this 
reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring 
range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated 
when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the 
stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. 
Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third 
party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a 
large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video 
products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers 
shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international 
norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, 
portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that 
is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, 
every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data 
leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network 
environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network 
security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that 
these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights 
or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, 
each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used 
in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.15INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that has 
become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment must 
dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment 
does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment 
shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed 
in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being 
destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This 
does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public 
waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private 
households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste 
management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors 
within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales 
area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and those grocery stores 
with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment 
several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are 
required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of 
distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic 
equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 
m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities 
at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste 
equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among 
other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered 
to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies 
in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as 
computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end user is 
responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie 
bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that the respective 
device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service 
life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are 
increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and 
quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For 
example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. 
This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it 
may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests 
if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the 
philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of 
video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and 
regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.
Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video 
products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a 
warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the 
monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public 
areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video 
products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining 
the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time 
and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably 
define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a 
third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes 
will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as 
facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data 
based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage 
depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data 
controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and 
other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, 
good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and 
respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always 
be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video 
products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. 
Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and 
necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper 
disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, 
selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video 
products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social 
security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an 
active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation 
of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent 
of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall 
establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to 
ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good 
faith.8INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that 
has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment 
must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste 
equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return 
systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste 
equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that 
are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste 
equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them 
in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse 
with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private 
households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste 
management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or 
distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. 
Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment 
and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer 
electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis 
and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in 
the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and 
shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the 
total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, 
ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from 
the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge 
exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new 
similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This 
applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology 
such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each 
end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed 
of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out 
wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that 
the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at 
the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are 
increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and 
quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For 
example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. 
This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it 
may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests 
if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the 
philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of 
video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and 
regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.
Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video 
products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a 
warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the 
monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public 
areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video 
products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining 
the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time 
and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably 
define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a 
third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes 
will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as 
facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data 
based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage 
depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data 
controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and 
other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, 
good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and 
respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always 
be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video 
products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. 
Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and 
necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper 
disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, 
selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video 
products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social 
security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an 
active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation 
of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent 
of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall 
establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to 
ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good 
faith.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are 
increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and 
quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For 
example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. 
This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it 
may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests 
if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the 
philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of 
video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and 
regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.
Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video 
products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a 
warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the 
monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public 
areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video 
products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining 
the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time 
and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably 
define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a 
third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes 
will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as 
facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data 
based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage 
depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data 
controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and 
other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, 
good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and 
respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always 
be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video 
products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. 
Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and 
necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper 
disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, 
selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video 
products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social 
security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an 
active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation 
of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent 
of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall 
establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to 
ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good 
faith.17INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that 
has become waste is referred to as waste equipment. Owners of waste equipment 
must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste 
equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return 
systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste 
equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that 
are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste 
equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them 
in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse 
with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private 
households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste 
management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or 
distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. 
Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment 
and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer 
electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis 
and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in 
the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and 
shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the 
total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, 
ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from 
the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge 
exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new 
similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This 
applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology 
such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each 
end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed 
of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out 
wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that 
the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at 
the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-
time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, 
use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring 
range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated 
when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a 
large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that 
is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, 
every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights 
or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, 
each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.12Appendix

2  INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that has become waste is referred to as waste 
equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries 
and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment 
without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical 
and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to 
take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular to devices of information 
and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end 
user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-
time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, 
use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring 
range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated 
when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a 
large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that 
is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, 
every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights 
or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, 
each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.12Appendix

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-
time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, 
use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring 
range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated 
when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a 
large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that 
is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, 
every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights 
or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, 
each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.12Appendix

1  Installation Location
Choose	a	location	 with	a	clear,	unblocked	 field	of	view	and	with	a	good	wireless	 signal	to	the	camera.	 Please	keep	the	following	
tips in mind:
•	Make sure the wall is strong enough to withstand three times the weight of the camera.
•	Recommended installation height: 7-10 ft (2-3 m) above the ground.
•	Recommended installation angle:  Tilt down 20 degrees.
•	Make	sure	that	side-to-side	 traffic	crosses	 camera’s	 field	of	view.	The	camera’s	 motion	sensor	is	much	more	sensitive	 to	
side-to-side	movement	across	its	field	of	view	than	to	movement	directly	toward	or	away	from	the	camera.
20°
Limited by PIR detection technology, the camera may fail to detect motion when environment temperature is close to 
human body temperature or someone approaches the PIR sensor vertically.
•	It is recommended to set detection sensitivity on the EZVIZ app when selecting location. Thus you can verify if motion can be 
detected in the camera’s placement and adjust the sensitivity based on the size and distance of detected object.

•	Do	not	place	the	camera	near	any	outlets,	including	 the	air	conditioner	 vents,	humidifier	 outlets,	the	heat	transfer	
vents of projectors, etc
•	Do not install the camera at places with strong wind .
•	Do not install the camera in front of a mirror.
•	Keep the camera at least 1 meter away from any wireless devices, including Wi-Fi routers and phones in order to 
avoid wireless interference.52  Install Micro SD Card (Optional)

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the	role	technology	 plays	in	improving	 business	 efficiency	 and	quality	of	life,	but	at	the	same	time,	
the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy 
of	“Technology	 for	the	Good”,	EZVIZ	requests	 that	every	end	user	of	video	technology	 and	video	
products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, 
aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should 
not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining 
the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and 
under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights 
in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be 
generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result 
of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data 
controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements,	 but	also	respect	international	 norms,	social	morality,	 good	morals,	common	 practices	
and	other	non-mandatory	 requirements,	 and	respect	individual 	privacy,	portrait	and	other	rights	and	
interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered 
when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid 
data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access 
control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around 
the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social 
life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are 
contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.11Appendix

a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste 
equipment,	 which	can	be	removed	 from	the	waste	equipment	 without	 being	destroyed,	 from	
the	waste	equipment 	before	handing	 them	in	at	a	collection 	point.	This	does	not	apply	if	waste	
equipment	is	prepared	for	reuse	with	the	participation	of	a	public	waste	management	authority.
3.	Options	for	returning	 waste	equipment:	 Owners	of	waste	equipment 	from	private	households 	
can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and

who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the 
same functions is delivered to an end user.
4.	Privacy	Notice:	Waste	equipment 	often	contains 	sensitive 	personal 	data.	This	applies	in	particular 	
to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. 
In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste 
equipment	to	be	disposed	of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin 
regularly	 depicted	 on	electrical	 and	electronic	 equipment	 indicates	 that	the	respective	 device	is	to	be	
collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Dear Valued EZVIZ Users,
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a forward-looking tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving efficiency and quality of our life. At the same time, we 
are also aware of the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products can record real, 
complete and clear images, therefore they hold great values in representing facts. Nevertheless, improper distribution, use and/or processing of video records may infringe on the privacy, legitimate rights and interests of others.
Committed to innovating technology for the good, we at EZVIZ hereby earnestly advocate that every user 
shall use video products properly and responsibly, thus to collectively create a positive environment where all related practices and usage comply with applicable laws and regulations, respect individuals’ interests and rights, and promote social morality.
Here are EZVIZ’s initiatives that we’d appreciate your attention:
1.Each individual possesses a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the use of video products should not be in conflict with such reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice which clarifies the monitoring range should be displayed in a reasonable and effective manner, when installing video products in public 
areas. For non-public areas, the rights and interests of people involved shall be evaluated thoughtfully, 
including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products without other’s knowledge.2.Video products objectively records footage of real activities within specific time and space. Users shall reasonably identify the people and rights involved in this scope in advance, to avoid any infringement 
of portrait, privacy or other legal rights of others while protecting themselves through video products. 
Notably, if you choose to enable the audio recording function on your camera, it will capture sounds, including conversations, within the monitoring range. We highly recommend a comprehensive assessment on the potential sound sources in the monitoring range, so as to fully understand the necessity and the 
reasonableness before you turn on the audio recording function.
3.Video products in use will consistently generate audio or visual data from real scenes –possibly including biometric information such as facial images – based on the user’s selection of product features. Such data can be used or processed to use. Video products are only technological tools that do not and cannot 
humanly practice legal and moral standards to guide lawful and proper use of data. It is the methods 
and purposes of the people who control and use the generated data that make a difference. Therefore, data controllers shall not only strictly abide by applicable laws and regulations, but also fully respect non-obligatory rules including international conventions, moral standards, cultural norms, public order and local 
customs. Furthermore, we should always prioritize the protection of privacy and portrait rights, and other 
reasonable interests.4.The video data continuously generated by video products carries the rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders. Thus, it is extremely crucial to ensure data security and shield the products from malicious intrusions. Every user and data controller shall, undertake all reasonable and necessary 
measures to maximize product and data security, avoiding data leakage, improper disclosure or misuse, 
including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 5.Video products have made great contributions to enhance the safety of our society, and we believe that 
they will continue to play a positive role in various aspects of our daily life. Any attempt to abuse these 
products to violate human rights or engage in unlawful activities contradicts the very essence of the value in tech innovation and product development. We encourage every user to establish your own methods and rules to evaluate and monitor the use of video products, so as to ensure that these products are always 
used properly, thoughtfully and with goodwill.13Appendix

Camera Installation
1  Installation Location
Choose	 a	location	 with	a	clear,	unblocked	 field	of	view	and	with	a	good	wireless	
signal to the camera. Please keep the following tips in mind. 
•	Make sure the wall is strong enough to withstand three times the weight of the 
camera.
•	Recommended installation height: 10.0 ft (3m);
•	Detection distance range: 6.5-32.8 ft (2-10m).
•	Make	sure	that	side-to-side	 traffic	crosses	 camera’s	 field	of	view.	The	camera’s	
motion	sensor	is	much	more	sensitive	 to	side-to-side	 movement	 across	its	field	
of view than to movement directly toward or away from the camera.
Limited by PIR detection technology, the camera may fail to detect motion when environment 
temperature is close to human body temperature or someone approaches the PIR sensor 
vertically.
It is recommended to set detection sensitivity on the EZVIZ app when selecting 
location. Thus you can verify if motion can be detected in the camera’s placement 
and adjust the sensitivity based on the size and distance of detected object.4Important Notes on Reducing Too Much Alarms:
•	Do not install the camera under strong light conditions, including sunshine, bright lamp 
lights, etc. 
•	Do	not	place	the	camera	near	any	outlets,	including	 the	air	conditioner	 vents,	humidifier	
outlets, the heat transfer vents of projectors, etc.
•	Do not install the camera at places with strong wind.
•	Do not install the camera in front of a mirror.
•	Keep the camera at least 1 meter away from any wireless devices, including Wi-Fi routers 
and phones in order to avoid wireless interference.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.11Appendix

Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households can return it free of charge to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular to devices of information and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and electronic equipment indicates that the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.

Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in 
improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video 
products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-
time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, 
use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end 
user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, 
aiming to jointly create a better community.
Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with 
this reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the 
monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be 
evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent 
of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. 
Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third 
party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a 
large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products 
themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the 
video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data 
controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect 
international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect 
individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that 
is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, 
every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid 
data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable 
network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing 
network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that 
these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human 
rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. 
Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every 
product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.6INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS

Dear Valued EZVIZ Users,
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a forward-looking tech company, we are increasingly 
aware of the role technology plays in improving efficiency and quality of our life. At the same time, we 
are also aware of the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products can record real, complete and clear images, therefore they hold great values in representing facts. Nevertheless, improper 
distribution, use and/or processing of video records may infringe on the privacy, legitimate rights and 
interests of others.Committed to innovating technology for the good, we at EZVIZ hereby earnestly advocate that every user shall use video products properly and responsibly, thus to collectively create a positive environment where all related practices and usage comply with applicable laws and regulations, respect individuals’ interests 
and rights, and promote social morality.
Here are EZVIZ’s initiatives that we’d appreciate your attention:1.Each individual possesses a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the use of video products should not be in conflict with such reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice which clarifies the monitoring 
range should be displayed in a reasonable and effective manner, when installing video products in public 
areas. For non-public areas, the rights and interests of people involved shall be evaluated thoughtfully, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products without other’s knowledge.
2.Video products objectively records footage of real activities within specific time and space. Users shall 
reasonably identify the people and rights involved in this scope in advance, to avoid any infringement of portrait, privacy or other legal rights of others while protecting themselves through video products. Notably, if you choose to enable the audio recording function on your camera, it will capture sounds, 
including conversations, within the monitoring range. We highly recommend a comprehensive assessment 
on the potential sound sources in the monitoring range, so as to fully understand the necessity and the reasonableness before you turn on the audio recording function.3.Video products in use will consistently generate audio or visual data from real scenes –possibly including biometric information such as facial images – based on the user’s selection of product features. Such 
data can be used or processed to use. Video products are only technological tools that do not and cannot 
humanly practice legal and moral standards to guide lawful and proper use of data. It is the methods and purposes of the people who control and use the generated data that make a difference. Therefore, data controllers shall not only strictly abide by applicable laws and regulations, but also fully respect non-
obligatory rules including international conventions, moral standards, cultural norms, public order and local 
customs. Furthermore, we should always prioritize the protection of privacy and portrait rights, and other reasonable interests.4.The video data continuously generated by video products carries the rights, values and other demands 
of various stakeholders. Thus, it is extremely crucial to ensure data security and shield the products 
from malicious intrusions. Every user and data controller shall, undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to maximize product and data security, avoiding data leakage, improper disclosure or misuse, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment where 
video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5.Video products have made great contributions to enhance the safety of our society, and we believe that they will continue to play a positive role in various aspects of our daily life. Any attempt to abuse these products to violate human rights or engage in unlawful activities contradicts the very essence of the value in tech innovation and product development. We encourage every user to establish your own methods and 
rules to evaluate and monitor the use of video products, so as to ensure that these products are always 
used properly, thoughtfully and with goodwill.12Appendix

2  INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that has become waste is referred to as waste 
equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste 
equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries 
and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households can return it free of charge 
to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular to devices of information 
and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical and 
electronic equipment indicates that the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end 
of its service life.

Initiatives on the Use of Video Products
Thank you for choosing EZVIZ products.
Technology affects every aspect of our life. As a high-tech company, we are increasingly aware of the role technology plays in improving business efficiency and quality of life, but at the same time, the potential harm of its improper usage. For example, video products are capable of recording real, complete and clear images. This provides a high value in retrospect and preserving real-time facts. However, it may also result in the infringement of a third party’s legitimate rights and interests if improper distribution, use and/or processing of video data takes place. With the philosophy of “Technology for the Good”, EZVIZ requests that every end user of video technology and video products shall comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, as well as ethical customs, aiming to jointly create a better community.Please read the following initiatives carefully:
1. Everyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the installation of video products should not be in conflict with this 
reasonable expectation. Therefore, a warning notice shall be given in a reasonable and effective manner and clarify the monitoring range, when installing video products in public areas. For non-public areas, a third party’s rights and interests shall be evaluated when installing video products, including but not limited to, installing video products only after obtaining the consent of the stakeholders, and not installing highly-invisible video products.
2. The purpose of video products is to record real activities within a specific time and space and under specific conditions. 
Therefore, every user shall first reasonably define his/her own rights in such specific scope, in order to avoid infringing on a third party’s portraits, privacy or other legitimate rights.
3. During the use of video products, video image data derived from real scenes will continue to be generated, including a 
large amount of biological data (such as facial images), and the data could be further applied or reprocessed. Video products themselves could not distinguish good from bad regarding how to use the data based solely on the images captured by the video products. The result of data usage depends on the method and purpose of use of the data controllers. Therefore, data controllers shall not only comply with all the applicable laws and regulations and other normative requirements, but also respect international norms, social morality, good morals, common practices and other non-mandatory requirements, and respect individual privacy, portrait and other rights and interests.
4. The rights, values and other demands of various stakeholders should always be considered when processing video data that 
is continuously generated by video products. In this regard, product security and data security are extremely crucial. Therefore, every end user and data controller, shall undertake all reasonable and necessary measures to ensure data security and avoid data leakage, improper disclosure and improper use, including but not limited to, setting up access control, selecting a suitable network environment (the Internet or Intranet) where video products are connected, establishing and constantly optimizing network security. 
5. Video products have made great contributions to the improvement of social security around the world, and we believe that 
these products will also play an active role in more aspects of social life. Any abuse of video products in violation of human rights or leading to criminal activities are contrary to the original intent of technological innovation and product development. Therefore, each user shall establish an evaluation and tracking mechanism of their product application to ensure that every product is used in a proper and reasonable manner and with good faith.15Appendix

2  INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS
1. Separate collection of waste equipment: Electrical and electronic equipment that has become waste is referred to as waste 
equipment. Owners of waste equipment must dispose of it separately from unsorted municipal waste. In particular, waste 
equipment does not belong in household waste, but in special collection and return systems.
2. Batteries and rechargeable batteries as well as lamps: Owners of waste equipment shall, as a rule, separate waste batteries 
and rechargeable batteries that are not enclosed in the waste equipment, which can be removed from the waste equipment without being destroyed, from the waste equipment before handing them in at a collection point. This does not apply if waste equipment is prepared for reuse with the participation of a public waste management authority.
3. Options for returning waste equipment: Owners of waste equipment from private households can return it free of charge 
to the collection points of the public waste management authorities or to the take-back points set up by manufacturers or distributors within the meaning of the Electrical and Electronics Equipment Law. Stores with a sales area of at least 400 m² for electrical and electronic equipment and those grocery stores with a total sales area of at least 800 m² that offer electrical and electronic equipment several times a year or on a permanent basis and make it available in the market are required to take it back. This also applies in the case of distribution using means of distance communication, if the storage and shipping areas for electrical and electronic equipment are at least 400 m² or the total storage and shipping areas are at least 800 m². Distributors shall, in principle, ensure take-back by providing suitable return facilities at a reasonable distance from the respective end user. The possibility of returning waste equipment free of charge exists for distributors who are obliged to take it back, among other things, if a new similar device that essentially fulfills the same functions is delivered to an end user.
4. Privacy Notice: Waste equipment often contains sensitive personal data. This applies in particular to devices of information 
and telecommunications technology such as computers and smartphones. In your own interest, please note that each end user is responsible for deleting the data on the waste equipment to be disposed of.
5. Meaning of the symbol “crossed-out wheelie bin”: The symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin regularly depicted on electrical 
and electronic equipment indicates that the respective device is to be collected separately from unsorted municipal waste at the end of its service life.
